You will receive exactly one scene from a D&D session.

Produce:
- scene_title — 3–8 words, no colon, no episode numbering.
- bullet_points — 4–6 bullets that capture only the primary events in this scene.

Rules
- Use past tense and in-world terms; do not mention the DM, dice, rolls, or mechanics.
- Each bullet is one clear sentence; lead with the key action or outcome.
- Prefer concrete nouns, named locations, and proper names as spelled in the input.
- Do not invent events or cross-reference other scenes.

Quality checks
- Remove filler (“then”, “suddenly”, “basically”) unless needed for meaning.
- Collapse redundant bullets; keep the 4–6 most important.
