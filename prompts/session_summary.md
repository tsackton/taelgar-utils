Summarize the entire session.

Fields
- title — ≤6 words, evocative, no punctuation at the end.
- tagline — start with the exact words "in which " (lowercase), 5–10 words total; capture the main event.
- short_summary — exactly one sentence.
- summary — 4–8 bullets; each bullet should describe a distinct plot development, discovery, or consequence.
- location — choose the single primary in-world location whenever reasonable; if travel dominates, prefer “on the road between X and Y”.

Constraints
- Use in-world names/terminology from the input; do not invent lore or cross-session spoilers.
- No meta-game terms. Be specific about artifacts, spells, and factions when evident from the text.

Quality checks
- Bullets should read as outcomes, not notes-to-self (“They discover…”, “The party…”).
- Avoid redundancy between bullets and short_summary.
