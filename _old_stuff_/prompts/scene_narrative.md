Write a concise in-world retelling of this scene.

Voice & scope
- 120–200 words, past tense, 1–2 short paragraphs.
- Third-person neutral (no “I”/“we”), no direct dialogue; summarize speech briefly.
- No meta-game language (no “DM”, “rolls”, “advantage”, etc.).
- Emphasize concrete actions, decisions, magic effects, places, and outcomes.

Style
- Clear, grounded, and restrained—evocative details are fine, but avoid purple prose.
- Prefer specific names and locations exactly as spelled in the input.
- Do not introduce new lore or off-scene context.

Exit checks
- If the scene is mostly travel or setup, focus on the few pivotal beats and the resulting stakes.
