1
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.680
Mike: basically set.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.980
Mike: Except cups that have a name, except… except Druid guy.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.830
David S. Kong: Oh, mine's Echo.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.400
Mike: about.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.730
Kate Sackton: I don't.

6
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.460
Mike: Right.

7
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.020
David S. Kong: But E, KKO, spelled weird.

8
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.739
Mike: Your… your D&D Beyond character still just says Druid Guy.

9
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.170
David S. Kong: I'll, I'll change, change that.

10
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.919
Eric Rosenbaum: Echo, Justice, YOLO, and… what are the other two?

11
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.599
Tim Sackton: Been in Oakstride.

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.030
Mike: Fit in Oak Stride and drain.

13
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.660
Kate Sackton: drain.

14
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.630
Mike: Bandwish.

15
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.300
Eric Rosenbaum: Awesome.

16
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.640
David S. Kong: Wow.

17
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.230
Tim Sackton: So, the chasm really needs a name, but I'm not gonna come up with that tonight. I've pushed some brainstorming notes of the chasm mic.

18
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.830
David S. Kong: Oh, good.

19
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.649
Tim Sackton: I just like the Chasm, the Chasm's kind of cool. I don't know that it would have… why would it have an.

20
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.530
Mike: That's true.

21
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.990
Tim Sackton: It was the chasm?

22
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.049
Mike: Yeah, that's nuts.

23
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.409
Eric Rosenbaum: That's true. There's not some other…

24
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.280
Mike: then that's another chasm. Chasm? Chasm? Fucking great. Yeah.

25
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.140
Mike: Right.

26
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.150
Mike: So it's, it's, what, January 17…

27
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:20.609
Mike: 29, so, like, before our campaign… before Campaign 2 really got started, right? Like, Kenzo's… it's 10 years… 10 years after Rye screwed the world by, like, trying to save the world.

28
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.239
Mike: And the… and the ooze came to be.

29
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.569
Mike: set in… in… in… in the far north.

30
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.540
Mike: Or not the far north, but in the north, near the chasm, on some cold January night.

31
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.850
Mike: Actually, wait, Kate, are you committed to being… to being… hunting a… Hunting a friend.

32
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.459
Kate Sackton: If it helps you to have some other story going on, let me know.

33
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.000
Mike: Yeah, you could be the… you could be the messenger who… who gets… you could be the person who gets the message that there's this…

34
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:06.909
Mike: person, and be the one who brings the news of this person who's emerged from the chasm to Finian Injustice.

35
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.120
Kate Sackton: Sure!

36
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.860
Mike: Because you're like…

37
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.189
Mike: despite, you know, drain, despite it being January, is not gonna stay cooped up in a village, right? Like, you're used to…

38
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:33.079
Mike: the Mezai, the woodswalkers of Breva, don't… don't sleep in the winter. That's when it's dark and the goblins are more likely to come out, right?

39
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:43.240
Mike: You know, so, echo and YOLO… YOLO? Are you actually… it's actually pronounced.

40
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.980
David S. Kong: Yeah, I love it.

41
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.700
Mike: It's good, it's good. Awesome.

42
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.250
Eric Rosenbaum: Love that.

43
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.110
Mike: So… so… Echo and YOLO

44
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.270
Mike: hear of, hold on, I…

45
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.019
David S. Kong: Now I'm like, are we cousins?

46
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.160
Mike: Well, it could be white.

47
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.630
Eric Rosenbaum: We may as well.

48
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.949
Mike: It could be, like, like, ancient cousins, right?

49
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.609
David S. Kong: I like, I like the, I like Echo and YOLO. It's like, that sounds like a good… good tandem.

50
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.990
Eric Rosenbaum: Good team.

51
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.720
Eric Rosenbaum: A little rocky at first, but we figured it out.

52
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.779
David S. Kong: Wait, so you fight primarily shooting, you're more like an arrow guy, or like, you're a brawler, or what's your fighting style?

53
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.350
Eric Rosenbaum: It's, yeah, Eros. I'm the, like, well-be of our team.

54
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.960
Mike: Yeah.

55
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.650
Mike: So… So the, the, the, the adventure starts, Echo and YOLO, with Echo and YOLO,

56
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:51.040
Mike: have… at the monastery, right? Like, you've… you've… you've got there, right? It's a… it's been an exceptionally cold January, and, like, the… the…

57
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.279
Mike: that… Storms blowing out of the monastery have been endless.

58
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.980
Mike: snow, right? There's, like, currently a column of snow just 15 miles, or whatever, going straight up.

59
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:17.209
Mike: Right? And then it falls back down, right? And so there's a heavy snowfall over the monastery, because there's just this jet of snow coming out of the chasm. Which is… which is unusual, and the weather's… but the weather's also been…

60
00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:28.520
Mike: been unseasonable. The Vesha Vaca, the Children of the Wind, have been concerned about the omens coming out of the chasm, because it's been snow.

61
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.929
Mike: all year.

62
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:48.390
Mike: Right? Last summer, it was snow, too. It's not supposed to snow in the summer, normally the chasm reflects the seasons, right? So it's actually been a hard year for the monastery as well. The crops have struggled in the constant snowfall. There's been, like, occasional ice storms with, like.

63
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.170
Mike: Blocks of ice the size of, like.

64
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.070
Mike: you know, boulders have come shooting out of the chasm and shattered against the walls.

65
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:08.880
Mike: But it's… but it's been the snow that's made everybody uneasy, and has brought… Echo,

66
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.869
Mike: To… as sort of one of the, sort of, spokespeople, or sort of,

67
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.279
Mike: as one of the people most attuned to, kind of, the chasm's energy and magic, to, like, come to see…

68
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:36.259
Mike: why is it… why is it speaking cold constantly? Why is it so… it's not supposed to be the same, right? It's nature, it's variable, it changes. It's supposed to always be… it's supposed to always be, sort of.

69
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:43.710
Mike: like the weather, right? Like, you don't expect it to snow every day, right? And…

70
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:59.490
Mike: So, there's been no good evidence for what has been causing this, and it took a while for you to come, but you've been at the monastery, sort of trying to understand what might be happening with the chasm. And…

71
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.310
Mike: you brought Echo, right? You went…

72
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.969
Mike: You came with Echo, right? Because Echo also wanted to… sorry, YOLO. I'm gonna get the two of you confused.

73
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:27.590
Mike: You came with Yolo, right, who… who had… who had crossed the mountains just before the snowfall, right? And so, actually, does it work for you guys if, like, you have actually been together, you were actually together for a little bit before you brought him to the… you might have been like, well, right, so it's been, like…

74
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:39.259
Mike: You crossed… Yolo crossed the mountains just before the winter struck, you know, but just before… you skirted through just before the last snowfall, right? Stupid decision. Who starts crossing the mountains in October? But you made it work.

75
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:48.020
Mike: Right? And, you know, got to Brevda in, like, December, and it's been a few weeks, and, like.

76
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.970
Mike: Echo was heading to the monastery.

77
00:06:52.180 --> 00:07:07.069
Mike: in a little bit, after, like, doing the appropriate preparations to, like, investigate along the chasm. And so you… you've been traveling for maybe 2 weeks, like, along the edge of the chasm, right? Together. Like, looking at the, you know, trying to understand what's been happening.

78
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.009
Mike: And you've showed up at the monastery in a…

79
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:19.539
Mike: cold winter night when the Kenku there are telling, you know, when you show up, the Kenku there say.

80
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:27.280
Mike: There's a woman, nobody… speaks her language, none of the Kenku do.

81
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:36.150
Mike: She… she's repeating something in a tongue none of you really understand. Wait, none of you speak Olds and Coven, right? None of the Kenku speak Olds and Coven, right?

82
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.970
Tim Sackton: I do.

83
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.910
Tim Sackton: I know you do.

84
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.720
Tim Sackton: Okay.

85
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.130
Mike: Yeah, you and Schwartz both do. I'm well aware.

86
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.940
Eric Rosenbaum: Hmm.

87
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:56.829
Mike: She's… she's… she's babbling, she's terrified, she appears… you… you gather from, like, rough translation, her name is Kalima, and… and she… she does not know where she is, she doesn't understand…

88
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:15.550
Mike: where the chasm, like… she doesn't really understand how she's here. She's… she's panicked, she… she talks about the… about, the… the words you do understand from her, and she talks about… she seems to be terrified

89
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.789
Mike: of somebody she refers to as only, Malken?

90
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.420
Mike: Who is a child, she says, of…

91
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:31.090
Mike: Or it's unclear if it's a child or is the Vakar, the spirit of the cruel west wind.

92
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.169
Mike: And, and, and… you're…

93
00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:50.529
Mike: who are concerned, and they know, you know, this… this woman, Drain, who occasionally makes a circuit, and they know how to reach you, and they know she's good at sending… at bringing messages to people.

94
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.050
Mike: And they've sent… they've sent… drain tube.

95
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:02.939
Mike: to find out. Who is this… nobody's… nobody's… nobody who didn't go into the chasm has come out in living memory.

96
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.140
Mike: Right? Occasionally, people go down and get lost, but the Kenku…

97
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:18.680
Mike: Don't… this person doesn't seem to have… to have, to have gone out, and… So…

98
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.750
Mike: after maybe a few days, I'm gonna sort of just narratively skip ahead a little bit, you know, drain fines.

99
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:33.629
Mike: justice and, Finian, who are… who are wintering in the village of…

100
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:41.150
Mike: Drov… Dravneka… Dravneka, which is, like, one of the villages that… You know, and…

101
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:47.660
Mike: Drain, you probably have encountered each other before, you at least know of Finian as, like, an expert in lore.

102
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.090
Tim Sackton: Finance.

103
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:56.350
Mike: like Finn, as an expert in war, and, and, and,

104
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:06.220
Mike: You find them, right? And, you know, bring them back to, sort of,

105
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:13.300
Mike: speak to this woman, right, as a, yeah.

106
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:28.020
Mike: favor, like, the Kenku, sort of, are calling in a favor, like, or asking for help, right? Like, we don't know what to do with this woman who's… who's talking about Maoquen, the Vakar, right? So you, a few days later, all of you have…

107
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.990
Mike: arrived.

108
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.159
Mike: Just enough to introduce each other and, you know.

109
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:40.040
Mike: It's late at night, and you're… you're… you're having some…

110
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.939
Mike: You know, tea, or soup, or sort of…

111
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:54.780
Mike: before going to talk to this… this woman's sleeping, right, because you arrive, sort of, in the evening, and, you know, you're introducing yourselves to each other,

112
00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:04.779
Mike: And… The… going to… planning to go, you know, talk tours as soon as you can.

113
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:16.180
Mike: The storm coming out of the chasm's particularly bad tonight. And… and as you're… Talking?

114
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:23.720
Mike: The… you hear, like, a rumbling, and… the snow…

115
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.229
Mike: Coming up with the chasm turns,

116
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:48.829
Mike: considerably thicker and stronger, and there's a massive gust of wind that blows, like, swirls, crashes the door open, swirls across all of you, and, like, like, you're blinded for a minute, and you… you're just, like, thrown about by the snow. It's… it's… it almost feels like fingers,

117
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.750
Mike: reaching out.

118
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.219
Mike: And then you wake up.

119
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.320
Mike: will start… you fall. Basically, it grabs you and pulls you, and you fall.

120
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.960
Tim Sackton: Could we actually start next time before we fall, so we can roleplay…

121
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.990
Mike: Yes, okay, fair enough.

122
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.200
Mike: Yes, we could.

123
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.859
Tim Sackton: I don't want to do it tonight, but…

124
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.030
Mike: Well, I was thinking originally of starting…

125
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:23.100
Mike: Of starting waking up in the… but no, you could do a… we could do a… we'll do a back… we'll do a flashback to when you all met each other right before you fell.

126
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.000
Tim Sackton: Yeah, just, like, 15 minutes.

127
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.280
Mike: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

128
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.000
Tim Sackton: Also, equipment.

129
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.510
David S. Kong: We just all have ladders.

130
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.700
Mike: Infinite Ladders. No!

131
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.280
Tim Sackton: I carry 47 ladders on…

132
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.070
David S. Kong: Who doesn't?

133
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.230
David S. Kong: They're going to a chasm. The one thing that we need is fucking land.

134
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.309
Mike: as a lot of ladders, right? .

135
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.020
Kate Sackton: I would…

136
00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:04.870
Mike: Ultimately… the… The adventure plan was you wouldn't start with a ton of equipment, because…

137
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.550
Mike: You're starting somewhere originally, right?

138
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:16.830
Mike: Originally, this was start in a dungeon, you have no idea how you got there, right? It's changed a little bit over the course of tonight.

139
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:22.249
Tim Sackton: No, that's fine. I'm happy to start with whatever I'm wearing in the… whatever I have in the common room.

140
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.460
Mike: But that's basically it, right? You're starting with, like, whatever you'd have in the common room. Right.

141
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:37.360
Mike: it's basically, like, minimal equipment type. You wouldn't have… you might have… maybe you'd have armor or a shield. It's okay to have, like, a weapon, but you wouldn't have, like, serious adventuring equipment.

142
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.050
Mike: And I'm sort of just skipping me. I was just not gonna do magic items.

143
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.440
Tim Sackton: It's fine.

144
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.899
Mike: Conceptually, maybe you'll have some, but no magic for right now.

145
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.979
Mike: So, yeah, just like, like…

146
00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:01.139
Mike: a small… pick, like, one or two, like, whatever… think of it this way. Actually, try and do this from, like, honest role-playing. You're, like, in the common room of this…

147
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.729
Mike: You've just liked Kevin from the cold. You've gotten settled into your room.

148
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:14.649
Mike: And then you've come back out to, like, meet these newcomers who have talked to this woman, who mysteriously is speaking an ancient language.

149
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:25.750
Mike: And you're just introducing yourself, so what would you have actually brought? What would you actually have with you? Just think about it. Next time, tell me what you would have actually had. I mean, maybe you're wearing your armor, maybe you're not, I don't know.

150
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.319
Mike: So, just to what you have with you out in the… and we'll start… we'll start…

151
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:39.739
Mike: Describing the scene where you end up, and then we'll flash back to meeting each other, and then we'll continue.

152
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.290
Mike: So, have a plan a little bit about what you would…

153
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.210
Mike: Role-play… we'll plan to do a little role-playing of everybody meeting each other first.

154
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.690
Eric Rosenbaum: Cool.

155
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.070
Mike: Okay.

156
00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:08.249
Tim Sackton: Okay. I really like this chasm. I gotta go, like, rewrite part of the adventure, though. Mike, there's not gonna be much in the way of session notes from this, but write down anything about people's backstories, I'm trusting that you're gonna hand.

157
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.780
Mike: Yeah, yeah.

158
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.230
David S. Kong: Whoa, Mike, Mike, the DM, this is, this is epic.

159
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.970
Tim Sackton: I know.

160
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.450
Eric Rosenbaum: Love it.

161
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:15.840
David S. Kong: like…

162
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.770
Eric Rosenbaum: So fun.

163
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:23.999
Mike: Great. Yeah, it's a high bar to live up to. It's a little… it's a little high pressure.

164
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.179
Tim Sackton: I'm sure it's great.

165
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.510
David S. Kong: You got it.

166
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.370
Tim Sackton: I like just making a character, I'm happy to, like.

167
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:38.139
Mike: Yeah, yeah. No, this was good. I like… oh, this is perfect. This is a part of the world that's totally undeveloped. I'm like, the chasm's very cool now, I'm very happy with it.

168
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.929
David S. Kong: Love the chasm. Into the chasm.

169
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.340
Mike: Yep. Got it, got it. Okay.

170
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:41.900
David S. Kong: winning title.

171
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.139
Tim Sackton: Okay, good night, everybody.

172
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:43.720
Mike: Good night.

173
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.180
Kate Sackton: May.

174
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:44.960
Eric Rosenbaum: Fair enough.
