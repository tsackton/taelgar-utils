This is the "Campaign Bible" for Taelgar, a collection of notes, information, and facts about the world that have been introduced in play. 

Currently, this i almost entirely derived from my long-running [[Dunmari Frontier Campaign]], but also includes some world lore originally developed many years ago for the adventures of [[Heroes of the Great War]], as well as lore from the [[Mawar Adventures]], from my brother's [campaign](https://msackton.github.io/taelgar1720/), set in the same world, and from a few [[Labyrinths of the Lost|short adventures]]. Eventually, this will grow to include world lore from other campaigns and one-shots, as I update and convert my notes. 

Over the years, we have created a lot of lore for the world of Taelgar. A good place to start is the [[Player's Guide]], which is a gentle introduction to the world of Taelgar, its history and gods, and the sentient [[species]] that live there.
