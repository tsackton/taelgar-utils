This is the "Campaign Bible" for Taelgar, a collection of notes, information, and facts about the world that have been introduced in play. 

Currently, this is largely derived from my long-running [[Dunmari Frontier Campaign]]. However, the stories of other campaigns and adventures, including the [[Great Library Campaign]], the episodic tales of [[Mawar Adventures]], and the [[Addermarch Campaign]] are also included. Many details have also been developed for my brother's [campaign](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/), set in the same world, as well as some [[Labyrinths of the Lost|short adventures]].

Over the years, we have created a lot of lore for the world of Taelgar. A good place to start is the [[Player's Guide]], which is a gentle introduction to the world of Taelgar, its history and gods, and the sentient [[species]] that live there.
