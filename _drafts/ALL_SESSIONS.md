## Narrative

#### With the Deno'qai

After returning from the [[Forest of Nightmares]], [[Delwath]] spends some time with the [[Ko'zula]], and in communion with the Meswati, learning about the lost tanshi who have now been found, about the history of this place and these people, about the stories that tie them to the tanshi, before leaving to seek out a way to reunite with his companions. 

![[kozula-village.png|500]]

During this time, [[Delwath]] also spends hours scrying: [[Scrying Delwath Oct 21]].

The most promising tales [[Delwath]] hears are of [[Safri]], a woman who appears in the woods, sometimes taking the form of an old woman but often in animal form, who knows the magic of the mountains and the alpine forests, and is powerful. Although [[Delwath]] also hears tales of elven cities hidden in the south, where he may be able to find a guide to lead him through the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]] in the ancient elven way, he decides to head into the mountains in search of [[Safri]]. 
#### Meeting Safri

After a several day journey into the mountains and a few days waiting in camp (during which time [[Delwath]] scrys some more: [[Scrying Delwath Oct 26]]), [[Safri]] appears in the form of a deer, and leads [[Delwath]] to her forest valley home.

![[safri-house.png|600]]

Here, [[Delwath]] and [[Safri]] talk. He hears tales of the Meswati, and asks of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and artifacts of power. While she knows little of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], she does talk about artifacts and how to destroy them. Nothing that was made cannot be unmade, she says, though the stronger the magic, the more the physical form resists destruction. She talks of volcanos where the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] touches the material world, or intense storms from the Plane of Air where lightning strikes which extraplanar power, as places where even the most powerful artifacts can be destroyed. 

She also mentions [[Radomir#Safri's Tale|the story]] of [[Radomir]], a foreigner she met also asking after how to destroy artifacts. 

In the morning, she opens a portal in a tree, connecting it to another one far away, on the slopes of the [[Sentinel Range]], and [[Delwath]] steps through. 
#### Dunmar Rumors

Over the next week or so, [[Delwath]] rides across the planes of [[Dunmar]], hiding his true identity. He hears lots of stories.

Some are about [[Delwath]], another [[Elves]] in these lands who saved both [[Karawa]] and [[Tokra]] (it does not seem to be public knowledge that you freed [[Sura]], for [[Delwath]] is neither blamed or praised for this action in the rumors you hear).

Many other are about [[Sura]]. Her camp is to the west, on the Parhaz river, a tributary of the [[Hara]] that joins north of [[Tokra]] (probably only a few days journey from where you met [[Saka]], and maybe a 4-5 day march to [[Tokra]]). 

But most of the stories are about [[Havdar]]: how his sword (the sword you gave him, from [[Agata's lair]]) was cursed by the Chardonians working in league with [[Nayan Karnas]], and how it turned on him, turning him to stone during a battle in the north, against an emaciated, nearly undead band of gnolls. The battle was nearly lost, but his troops rallied and [[Aagir]] blessed the strikes of [[Aram]] and turned the tide of battle. [[Havdar]]'s stone body was taken back to camp, and the story goes that the Lakan monks snuck out at night and cured him, showing [[Laka]]'s favor to [[Sura]]'s cause (but done secretly for fear of the might of the [[Chardon]] mages, allied with Karnas). In the past weeks, since his cure, [[Havdar]] has been everywhere, seemingly, recruiting for [[Sura]]'s armies -- both people and horses, usually willingly given (but you hear whispers - sometimes not so willingly taken). These are popular stories - people speak of him with awe, with wonder, sometimes with a tinge of fear. It is rumored that since his cure he has refused let the sword out of his sight (for fear of evil magic, it is said), and some people say he has turned the curse to his advantage, petrifying his enemies with a blow from his blade.

By Nov 4, [[Delwath]] is feeling anxious to reunite with his friends, and also hears from [[Riswynn]] that she is on her way from [[Tokra]] with news and letters. Turning east, he arrives at the fey crossing on Nov 11, and scries ([[Scrying Delwath Nov 15]]) until Nov 15th, when the party is reunited.---

During the journey from the [[Copper Hills]] to [[Orenlas]] and then to [[Tollen]], and during the time in Tollen while work is done on [[Vindristjarna]], the party spends time gathering information.
## Questions

- Is there a kingdom ruled by a vampire on the north coast of the Green Sea? **YES**
- Does [[Rodnya Voknaz]] currently have a jade piece of Rai’s hand? **UNKNOWN**
- Is [[Radomir]]’s sister Yelena a member of the Rodnya Voknaz? **YES**
- Is Lord Rhodar von Glauer a vampire? **YES**
- Are the Vargaldi human? **UNCERTAIN**

## Bastion Information

The map room and the hall of stories can each give you three true facts about something. This can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object for the Hall of Stories; or a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object for the Map Room. You have time to use each room 2-3 times during the journey and Tollen downtime. 
### Map Room (Ursk)

- [[Ursk]] is ruled by a council of powerful wizards, the heads of the eight rodnye
- The rodnye (singular: rodnya) are loose confederations of people, mostly magic-users but not exclusively, bound together by some kind of mysterious ritual
- Emigration is tightly controlled in Ursk, and the few people who do leave tend to be sickly and weak
### Map Room (Land between Ursk and Vostok)

- This is a land of boreal forests, swift rivers, and rocky coasts, with few people, a dangerous place, where dragon attacks are common
- Halfling memories do speak of a people who live in the forests, scattered groups related to the people of Vostok and the Sembaran Highlands, who worship animal spirits
- Rumors claim that once, before the [[Great War]], the giants of the [[Sivnjo Mountains]] (SHEEF-nyo; meta: the mountains forming the eastern border of Vostok - name might change) provided sanctuary and protection to many people - human, stoneborn, dwarf, and others - against the dangers of the north, but recent tales do not tell what has become of this protection
### Hall of Stories (Rodnya Voknaz)

Few, vague, and cryptic are the tales of the Rodnya, but here is what you are able to gather

- Pragmatism, not dogmatism, is the way of the Voknaz
- The Rodnya Voknaz is among the weakest and least influential of the Rodnye
- This does not mean the Rodnya Voknaz are weak: it is said the head of Voknaz can permanently turn boulders into young dragons with magic.

## Scrying

Reported here: [[Scrying Delwath Tollen Downtime]]

## Philosopher's Guild Information

- Letter about the [[Rodnya Voknaz]], received in trade for the silver wand from the Elemental Forge: [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Rodnya Voknaz]]
- Letter about Ursk and its cities and ways to access them, received in trade for the gem of demon summoning taking from Kadmos: [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Ursk]]

## Mirror Visions
- [[Magical Pale Blue Dye Vision]]
- [[Cecilia's White Dragon Tooth Vision]]
## Other Information

- A message from [[Fausto]] to [[Delwath]], via the Sending spell, received on Feb 25th: “[[Apollyon]] sends his regards, and asks: what's the matter, Delwath, don't you want to see the rest of my little surprise? Scared to watch?”
- Information recovered from the [[Kharsan]] Archives, by the painstaking work of Nuzkar, cross-referenced to books available in Tollen and now acquired for the Vindristjarna Archives, provides a [[Dunmar#History|chronicle of Dunmari history]] in the days before the Great War, detailing the [[Aatmaji Dynasty|first dynasty of Dunmari Samraats]], which ended with a disastrous expedition to destroy the lingering evil in Drankor led by Samraat Aatmaji [[Dasa]], who died in the attempt. While most of this is fragmentary, [[Nuzkar]] is able to reconstruct two notes:
	- [[Report of the Aagiri to Samraat Dasa]]
	- [[An Annotated (Partial) Map of Drankor]]---

## Narrative
[[Seeker]] of Highkeep, [[Wellby]] Goodbarrel, [[Kenzo]], and [[Delwath]] the [[Elves|Elf]] all meet as they rush in to save the villagers of [[Karawa]] from two rampaging giant hyenas. They defeat the hyenas (one killed by [[Kenzo]], with staff and bare hands, and the other attacked with magical flames by [[Delwath]], distracted by an illusory baby antelope and tripped into a hole in the ground by [[Seeker]], then stabbed by [[Wellby]]), managing to keep all the villagers alive; one of the villages, a woman with a touch of divine magic named [[Beli]], helps in the battle. Afterward, they talk in the tea room below [[Delwath]]'s house, while the server [[Badya]] helps tend the wounded. Speaker [[Candrosa]], the leader of the [[Shakun Mystai]], and Elder [[Kisa]], leader of [[Karawa]], arrive and discuss the attacks -- these are the latest and most dangerous in a string of mysterious attacks. [[Kisa]] asks [[Delwath]] to investigate the problem, and he gets everyone else to help.

Investigating the beasts, they seemed to have fought other battles before arriving in the village. Some skillful tracking from [[Delwath]] and [[Wellby]] allowed the party to pick up the trail of the beasts, leading a bit north of due east, into the desert.

After about half a day of travel, the terrain gradually became rockier, eventually leading you to an area of small box canyons and rocky terrain, where you lost the trail of the beasts. As [[Delwath]] and [[Kenzo]] talked, and [[Seeker]] pondered geology, [[Wellby]] realized that, in this twisting terrain, he was starting to be unsure of which direction was which and even where [[Karawa]] lay. Climbing via grappling hook to a high point, he looked around, seeing nothing stirring across the canyonlands, which extended for miles to the east towards a large, distant canyon. To the north, a cloud of dust pointed towards something moving along the old trade road.

On the road, the party ran into [[Alesh]], a Dunmari scout returning from the [[Gomat]] oasis, where she had spent the night with [[Akan]] and his family, who were grazing their herds in the area. They discussed the attacks on the town, and [[Alesh]] talked about how in her childhood people were scared, but for the past decade the [[Nashtkar]], the blasted plains, had seemed, if not safe, at least less of a constant threat to [[Karawa]]. But perhaps that was changing. She rode on for the grazing lands north of [[Karawa]].

The party pushed on towards the [[Gomat]] oasis, traveling hard and long, into the night as they pushed through the desert heat and into the night to get to [[Gomat]] as quickly as possible. Exhausted from the long, hard day of travel, they arrive at the oasis, only to see tents, yes, but also three enormous lizards, 10 feet long and scaly, ripping into dead sheep scattered across the ground.

We begin with the party contemplating the locked iron gate. While [[Wellby]] sneaks off to make sure [[Inakara]] is really departing, and see if there is anything else useful to find, the rest of the party tries to get past the gate, eventually resorting to [[Riswynn]] smashing it to pieces with her warhammer. Beyond the gate, a long tunnel leads east, albeit not one of Dwarven construction, according to [[Seeker]]. The tunnel continues at least 1500’, sloping down and then up slightly, before spiraling up in a corkscrew twist and emerging into a small chamber with a hole in the ceiling, leading up. While some iron spikes still in the walls hint that perhaps a ladder of some kind used to hang here, it is long gone. 

[[Riswynn]] climbs to the top, and drops a rope down for everyone else. As [[Wellby]] arrives, the party gathers in an old, disused cavern, seemingly once a storeroom, to discuss. After much talk, including the report from [[Wellby]] of signs of [[Hobgoblins]] in the [[Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)|dwarven outpost]] and his sighting of a large animated iron statue of Dwarven make apparently guarding something, conversation halts as [[Wellby]] hears something scrabbling around down the corridor. Exploring invisibly, [[Delwath]] spots two undead [[Hobgoblins]] rooting through some old skeletons, snapping bones in half. Exploring north and south, he also finds two exits from these caverns: one to the north blocked by a cave in, and one of the south leading to an iron gate, a small bridge, and a tower. Realizing it probably isn’t safe to explore while these creatures are roaming around, the party sets and ambush and makes quick work of the creatures. The room they were in seems to be an old, disused prison, probably [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]]: decapitated skeletons point towards an execution block, and iron manacles attached to the walls suggest prisoners were kept or tortured here.

Having dealt with the undead threat quickly and efficiently, the party splits up to explore. [[Riswynn]], [[Delwath]], and [[Seeker]] head north, where they watch from between the cracks in the rubble. Outside, a small plaza at the entrance to [[Raven's Hold]] is guarded by some gnolls: three at first, who then leave and are replaced by another four. Also nearby, although not in sight, are a large number of wild animals, making a huge ruckus. Dogs, hyenas, jackals, and at least one lion can be heard, and at one point the gnolls go to feed these creatures, it seems. [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] head south, and watch from the iron gate. From here, they can see two towers and a gate house protecting the inner courtyard of the stronghold, as well as the inner keep, from which firelight seems to occasionally flicker. Nothing seems to be moving in the inner courtyard, however, or coming in or out of the keep.

After coming back to discuss some more, [[Delwath]] casts invisibility on [[Kenzo]], who heads to scout the tower. The first tower is devoid of life, at least on the three top floors. The second floor, where the bridge enters, contains little of note, except a barred door that seems to lead across the top of the gate house towards the second tower. The third floor contains small apartments and servant’s quarters, also with little of note. The fourth floor seems to have been used as the quarters of a hobgoblin commander, with a small desk, a bed, and the mark of the [[Blackened Claw]] carefully painted on one wall.

Crossing to the second tower, [[Kenzo]] finds the second floor of this tower to be largely the same as the first tower, lacking anything of note but some guard chambers and stairs up and down. Heading up, [[Kenzo]] comes face to face (invisibly) with an [[Orcs|orc]], who has set up chambers of sorts on this floor (the third floor). Sneaking past, and heading up to the top (fourth floor), [[Kenzo]] finds a [[Vola|prisoner]], guarded by two seeming-humans. Whispering to her to hold tight and cutting her bonds, he heads back to fetch the rest of the party and try to rescue this person.

Together, the party moves quietly to the top of the stairs on the second tower. One of the guards is now blocking the stairs up, and the [[Orcs|orc]] and the other guard seem to be in the [[Orcs|orc]]’s chambers. [[Seeker]] puts one guard to sleep; while the thump alerts the [[Orcs|orc]] and the other guard, the party is able to defeat them, despite some surprises, including the fact that non-magical weapons do not seem to hurt the guards at all, who shifted into part-human, part-jackal hybrids at the start of combat. 

After defeating these creatures, [[Vola]] Forena, the prisoner, is freed. As the sun is setting, the party and [[Vola]] head to the first tower, bar the door, and talk briefly. [[Vola]] is Chardonian, a member of the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], a group that is hunting for old artifacts of [[Drankor]] across the plains; [[Arcus]] was also a member of this group, she reveals. [[Vola]] came towards [[Raven's Hold]] almost two weeks ago, thinking it a likely place to find old relics, but was captured by the [[Orcs|orc]] and his guards, and kept prisoner for the last 10 days. She has learned from her captors that an evil [[fey]] creature, [[Agata]] Dustmother, is also seeking to find old artifacts in the [[Nashtkar|Blasted Plains]] and across [[Dunmar]], as the [[Orcs|orc]] kept pressing her for information on what the Society had found and where, letting slip that he needed information to report to [[Agata]]. Needing some food and drink before continuing, we leave [[Kenzo]], [[Delwath]], [[Wellby]], [[Seeker]], [[Riswynn]], and [[Vola]], as they prepare their evening meal as the sun begins to set on [[Raven's Hold]].

We begin as the sun begins to set, as the party, holed up in an empty guard tower protecting the inner keep of [[Raven's Hold]], tends to their wounds and sits down for a quick meal with [[Vola]] Forena, an adventurer from [[Chardon]] just rescued by the party. [[Vola]], a member of the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], has been a prisoner for about 10 days. During her captivity, she noticed that the noise of the animals - now a loud cacophony of howls - started a few days after she was captured, and has been growing every since. 

After some discussion of plans and next steps, the party discusses the situation with [[Vola]], where they learn several notable pieces of information. She arrived, by herself, 10 days ago, when the entire place seemed empty, on a mission to search for lost artifacts of the [[Drankorian Empire]] and return them to [[Chardon]]. She had sought [[Raven's Hold]], as there is a rumor that after it was abandoned by [[Hobgoblins]], it was briefly the lair of a three-headed beast, a creature part lion, part dragon, part goat, that may have left behind some treasure. Moving through the fortress, she was captured by an [[Orcs|orc]] and two jackalweres, working for someone called [[Agata]] Dustmother, a possibly fey creature, hundreds of years old. Her captors wanted information on where they could find hidden Drankorian treasures, and when she tried to dissemble they said they would just take her to [[Agata]], but had to wait to make sure the ritual succeeded before they could leave. 

Determined to find out more of what was going on in the evening, before sleep and despite [[Vola]]’s protestations that she was utterly exhausted after nights of bad dreams and haunted sleep, the party decided a scouting mission should investigate the inner keep. [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] set up to explore, [[Wellby]] turned invisible by [[Delwath]]’s magic. Finding their way down to the inner courtyard of the fort, where mists and vapors rising from the ground shrouded them, they began to investigate the inner keep.

In the flickering firelight from the windows and open doorway of the keep, [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] explore. While investigating, [[Kenzo]] accidently makes some noise, and a undead gnoll creature, with flesh dropping off its bones, hears and looks directly at him. Moving quickly, [[Kenzo]] rushes forward, missing with his staff but moving with supernatural speed to make two quick unarmed strikes that bring the creature down, apparently without anyone noticing. Looking into the main hall of the keep, [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] see a demon, a kind of goat-like bipedal creature with horns, vicious claws, a barbed tail with a stinger, and flies buzzing around festering sores all over its body. Flames flicker in several places across the room, as the demon just paces back and forth, waiting for something. 

Returning to the tower, the party discuses what to do again, and eventually decides that they need to know more about what is happening, and sends [[Wellby]] back to watch. After the sun sets, the demon begins dragging bodies of animals off a pile in the chapel, and dragging its claws through the flesh, causing it to start to rot and bubble with pus. It then drags each body to the main entrance, and does this to another. Returning to discuss with the party, [[Seeker]] notes the similarity of this to the belief among some demon cults described in a book he read several years ago, who believed the consumption of flesh of a demon would give the consumer the powers of a demon. 

Deciding they need to kill this thing, the party and [[Vola]] sneak across the inner courtyard and attack the demon and its undead gnoll allies. The battle is difficult, as the poisoned sting of the demon’s barbed tail causes considerable pain: [[Delwath]] and [[Kenzo]] both suffer the effects of its sting, there flesh beginning to rot and attract flies. During the battle [[Delwath]] is nearly killed, and the party struggles, but in the end [[Kenzo]] dispatches the demon with a expertly placed strike. After the battle, while [[Kenzo]] sits outside mediating with [[Vola]], the rest of the party begins to search the keep. Although mostly empty, they do find a few signs of hobgoblin occupation, including a stack of notes that seem to document troop movements or something similar, in an unknown language. 

Back in the tower, settling in to rest, the party’s sleep is disturbed by dark dreams, disturbing their rest. We leave [[Kenzo]], [[Riswynn]], [[Delwath]], [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and [[Vola]] as they struggle awake in the morning sun.---

We begin as the morning sun rises over [[Raven's Hold]]. As the party awakens and prepares for the day, they are interrupted as [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] note the approach of a band of gnolls, heading towards the closed gate. They are traveling with a small bat-like demon, and moving quickly across the courtyard, past pools of fetid black water, avoiding the low hanging mists lingering in the air. As they approach the gate, they bang on it a few times, and there seems to be a brief discussion as the leader reaches for a spear, when [[Wellby]]’s arrow flies out of the windows on the tower, striking the demon-beast dead.

With that, the battle is joined in full. The gnolls make an attempt at firing arrows at the party, but as they are in a well-defended position this has little effect, and they begin to be slowly picked off. As they start to retreat, [[Kenzo]] leaps off the wall, landing gently on his feet as he draws on his ki to slow his fall, and opens the gate. The gnolls immediately take the bait, and turn and run forward, trying to break through the door, as [[Kenzo]] holds his ground, deflecting arrows and sending them back at the gnolls with a flick of his hands. However, the charge of the gnolls is hard to withstand, and eventually they are able to push through the door, leading to a pitched battle for control. While [[Wellby]] and [[Seeker]] manage to take down the leader in the distance, [[Kenzo]], [[Riswynn]], [[Delwath]], and [[Vola]] eventually defeat the gnolls at the gates.

However, one gnoll manages to escape towards the outer gates of [[Raven's Hold]]. While [[Seeker]] excavates pits to hold the hyenas he put to sleep earlier, [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] sprint after the escaping gnoll. They track it down in front of an outer plaza, near the outer gates of [[Raven's Hold]] itself, where several other gnolls are rushing to attack. As [[Riswynn]] and [[Delwath]] catch up, the last gnolls are quickly dispatched, and the party gathers on the remains of a parade ground and plaza, near the outermost walls of [[Raven's Hold]]. 

After the gnolls are defeated, a calm seems to settle over the holdfast, broken only by the cacophonous sounds of wild animals penned up in the stables to the north. [[Seeker]] and [[Kenzo]] investigate the animals, while [[Riswynn]] and [[Wellby]] explore the crumbling buildings and barracks that sit between the plaza and the outer courtyard, and [[Delwath]] keeps watch over the valley, where nothing seems to be moving.

In the ruins of the stables, many dozens of animals are penned in, probably close to a hundred in total. Some are chained, while others are trapped by rubble and stone, and still others are tied crudely with rope. All are gaunt and look starving, as if they have not been adequately fed for days. [[Seeker]], using his magic to speak with them, learns that they were captured on the plains in the past days, and have been kept here, starving, since. For what purpose, the beasts don’t know.

In the ruins of the outbuildings of [[Raven's Hold]], [[Wellby]] and [[Riswynn]] glance about without doing a careful search, but still note some important clues. Between the courtyard with the dark pools of water and the parade grounds / plaza, are two large buildings, seemingly once barracks, storerooms, and mess halls for troops. Both are in somewhat poor condition. The building to the east, against the cliffs of the mountains, seems to have been burned at one point, as the second floor is largely in ruins, scorch marks blasted across the stone walls and the roof collapsed. The first floor of this building, though, may have been used as sleeping quarters by the gnolls. 

The building to the west, against the outer walls, is more intact, and retains signs of former hobgoblin occupation. The second floor has a large open mess hall, probably used as a training and council room by [[Hobgoblins]]. In this room, a number of crates are piled up, seemingly full of weapons and armor. On the lower floor, a number of empty storerooms are found, along with one room with a chain and lock blocking entry.

The leader of the gnolls, dead in the outer courtyard, is carrying a few items of note. First, his [[Spear of the War Leader|spear]], while filthy and covered in blood, seems to be well made and of Dunmari origin, as beneath the grime the running horse design can be seen. Also, around his neck is a chain with a [[Vial of Acid (Gnoll Leader)|small metal vial]], which seems to be full of some acrid, hissing liquid. 

The session ends as the party gathers again, finally has a break and some breakfast, and discusses their next steps.

We begin as the party is finishing breakfast in the quiet of [[Raven's Hold]], the silence and stillness broken only by the howling of animals trapped in the stables, while contemplating the secrets of [[Raven's Hold]]. Wanting to figure out the mystery of where the gnolls came from, what the demon was doing, and how this is all connected, the party decides to explore.

In the outer barracks and outbuildings of [[Raven's Hold]], they find a number of treasures. Some, left scattered and hidden in the ruins of what seemed to have been the lair of a large monster at one point, including a [[Helm of Iron Will|silver helm]] from [[Drankor]], and an [[Elemental Gem|enchanted red gem]]. Others, locked away in a storeroom dating to the hobgoblin occupation of this fort, including a few useful potions and a very creepy [[Hobgoblin Battle Standard|hobgoblin standard]]. However, the only real clue about the gnolls is the discovery of a number of recently delivered weapons and armor: a scattered mess of various seemingly-scavenged items, some Dunmari of various ages, some older, some recent, crude but effective construction. Enough to arm and equip maybe 100 soldiers, to at least a basic level. 

While the rest of the party is scouting these buildings, [[Delwath]] wanders off to look around with his fey sight. Sensing an aura of extraplanar energy lingering over the holdfast, he begins to explore and realizes that the source of this abyssal energy seems to be coming from the valley, not the mists or dark waters of the castle. Wanting to deal with this Abyssal corruption before attempting to free the animals, they head into the valley.

About a half mile down the well-constructed dwarven road, they come to the river and the sweeping arch of a marble and quartz bridge spanning it, beautifully and elegantly constructed by [[Dwarves]]. The river itself, however, is dark and sluggish, obscured by mists and fog, and clogged with bruised-looking thorny plants and matted plant material. On the ground near the river is a circle of runes. [[Delwath]], looking with his shadow sight, watching the Abyssal runes form into meaning: “I bind you. I call you. I command you. Enter, and obey, for a month and a day." 

As [[Delwath]] moves to scratch out the circle with his shadow sword, from the river movement erupts, and the tangled vines and thorns coalesce into a ten-foot-tall humanoid creature, which moves to strike. As it attacks and the party fights back, a miasma oozes out from the demonic plant creature, poisoning [[Kenzo]]. After a short, intense fight, the creature is destroyed, and [[Riswynn]] uses a scroll found in the ruins to heal [[Kenzo]] before the poison and disease take hold. As [[Seeker]] finishes destroying the circle of runes by reshaping the ground beneath them, the river bursts forth, sweeping away the corruption of the demonic presence here. 

With the corruption fading from the land, the party searches the area, and finds what seems to be the [[Ivory Scroll Cap|remains]] of a spell scroll, presumably what was used to create this circle. Turning back to the castle, and the animals trapped within, [[Seeker]] uses his ability to speak with animals, combined with weaving compelling magic into his words, to suggest that the largest, most dominant lion lead the pack away from here to live free and disperse on the plains. As the animals file out under the sway of [[Seeker]]’s magic and the lion, [[Wellby]] climbs on the back of the lion and rides off with them into the valley.

Feeling satisfied that at least the demonic danger has passed, and with some hypotheses about what has happened at [[Raven's Hold]], the party returns to their horses through the dwarven fortress, avoiding [[Inakara]] and her people. On the way, they stop to investigate a large, living statute of stone that [[Wellby]] had seen while scouting. It seemed to be guarding the forge and mines, but also to be quite damaged. After some brief conversation in dwarvish, and [[Riswynn]] showing the [[Shield of the Brawnanvil Clan|shield of her family]], the statue defers to them and lets them pass, although it seems magically resistant to [[Seeker]]’s attempts to shrink it for transport. The forge and mine area is mostly destroyed, seemingly attacked by something, perhaps whatever damaged the statue. However, there is some of the adamantium, a valuable and extremely hard metal, left, which the party takes on their floating disk, with the half-plate from the hobgoblin storeroom. 

Returning to their horses, the party heads south in the few hours of afternoon light left, before making camp as the sun sets, near the south road back into [[Dunmar]] and the pass north.---

We begin with the party camped a few miles west of [[Raven's Hold]], near the trade road over the mountains, listening to the recovering wildlife of open plains as the campfire crackles, and [[Vola]] brings in a brace of birds to roast for dinner.

At camp, while [[Vola]] is cooking, the party spends some time trying to sort out the events of the past two days: the demon, rumors of [[Agata]] Dustmother, [[Vola]]’s rescue, the demonically possessed vine beast and the now-broken summoning circle, gnolls and rituals involving ritually slaughtered antelope, and the many packs of wild beasts kept and freed, some now audible on the plains. After discussion of [[Vola]] and whether to trust her ([[Riswynn]]: definitely no; [[Kenzo]]: maybe we should talk to her), and what to do next (travel to [[Karawa]], or investigate the storm), dinner is ready.

At dinner, discussion continues with [[Vola]]. She makes the argument that, even if they don’t fully trust the [[Society of the Open Scroll|Society]], the fact that [[Agata]] is seeking powerful ancient artifacts is a reason to be allies, because surely the Society, whatever disagreements we have about the proper ownership of lost treasure, is better than someone who summons [[demons]] and creates armies of hellbeasts. She is also concerned that the Society does not know much about [[Agata]] or the other events on the plains, and how dangerous the territory out here has gotten. Indeed, when she left [[Chardon]] four months ago, the Society had no knowledge of [[Agata]] at all - and she wants to return to [[Chardon]] as quickly as possible to warn them. Some debate about what to do with dangerous knowledge - whether it should be studied and protected or destroyed - ensues, along with questions about what exactly the Society intends to do with recovered artifacts and treasure that makes them better than [[Agata]], and why the Society is seeking treasure now in particular. 

As the conversation ranges among topics, it becomes clear that there is some interest among at least some members of the party in investigating the large permanent storm on the plains, and [[Vola]] agrees to ride in that direction for now. While she is eager to return to [[Chardon]], this is not far out of the way. So, the party plans to rise early the next morning and head west.

As the next day dawns, and Kenzo awakes [[Kenzo's Dream of Monks|troubled by dreams]], [[Wellby]] returns to camp followed by an axebeak as the party sets out west on a clear, bright morning. Traveling across the plains is relatively uneventful, although quickly the party begins to enter the burnt area around the storm, a landscape of ash and the occasional burnt tree stump. A wildfire caused by lightning strikes from the storm burned through here recently, and the landscape is barren, with flashes of lightning visible in the distance as the party makes camp for the evening. According to a vulture that scouted for [[Wellby]], the storm is impenetrable, but there is a clear area in the center where a white rock sits on a black rock. Buoyed by this news, the party renews their determination to press on in the morning.

The next day, the party reaches the edge of the storm by mid-afternoon. Dark clouds loom overhead, and the noise of wind and thunder is near-constant here. The air is hot and close, and lightning flashes overhead are near-constant. There is little rain, but looking into the storm, heavy rains lurk in the distance, and mists and fog keep visibility low and movement difficult as the party proceeds into the storm.

Pressing forward, the storm grows more intense, as visibility drops and the rain picks up, although the ground is surprisingly dry, as if the strength of the wind is just blowing the rain in a whirlwind and not letting any of it touch the ground. Reaching the most intense part of the storm, the party notices that the bare ground is shifting and shaping into vague, large runes, reminiscent of giants. [[Seeker]] and [[Delwath]] both attempt to read them. For [[Delwath]], they seem to be ordering him to attack the dwarf, [[Seeker]], and he cannot resist the compulsion, lashing out with his sword. As [[Riswynn]] quickly holds [[Delwath]] still with magic, to [[Seeker]] the runes are reshaping, questioning, asking him what he wants to know, pushing [[Seeker]] to ask a question of them. The compulsion on [[Delwath]] slowly fades, and no one else attempts to read the writing as the party quickly moves past. 

Some time later -- distance and time being hard to judge in the endless storm -- the weather gets darker and wetter, lightning flashes more frequently, and eventually the party reaches what seems to be a wall of wind. [[Riswynn]]’s horse cannot take any more, and bolts. The sound is deafening, and as the party attempts to push through the wind, [[Riswynn]] and [[Kenzo]] are blown off their feet, eventually rescued by [[Wellby]]’s telepathy, [[Kenzo]]’s [[Driftglobe]], and a rope. 

Inside the storm, there is a circle of dead calm stretching several hundred feet across. In the middle of this calm area, a jagged piece of blue granite juts out of the ground, almost as if it were the prow of a boat, tilted at an angle rising out of the land. Rising from the granite is a [[Stormcaller Tower|tall white marble tower]], 4 or 5 stories high, with a platform stretching out across the land below from the top. All seems silent and still, with no lights or movement coming from the tower. However, in the shelter of the granite rock, a small campsite and grave marker can be found, carved crudely with the symbol of the [[The Sibyl]], the goddess of knowledge and magic, one of the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] worshipped in [[Chardon]] and many other places influenced by the [[Drankorian Empire]]. These are weeks, but not months old. 

[[Stormcaller Tower]] itself seems to be of considerable interest. [[Seeker]] notes valuable metal (gold and silver) near the top, as well as something hard to describe or place running through the walls, and another unusual mineral inside the granite rock. There is also a substantial ley line node directly under the tower. [[Delwath]] decides to turn invisible and go investigate the tower. There are old, worn stairs switchbacking up the side of the granite rock to the tower entrance. The doors have been blasted apart, leaving only twisted remains of a door frame intact, little bits of wrought iron and silverwork. Inside, it looks like a tornado struck the first floor. Perhaps once a main hall, there is a fireplace but otherwise little survives but tangled rubble and a curving staircase leading up. While this destruction is recent, [[Stormcaller Tower]] itself seems very, very old. As [[Delwath]] investigates, every now and then little sparks run up and down the walls, seeming to concentrate wherever [[Delwath]] is poking around the rubble. 

The second floor is not nearly as destroyed, and appears to be a living space, with some small rooms and one larger room, all with closed doors, the smaller ones wooden and the large room iron and silver, which [[Delwath]] passes by to ascend the stairs to the third floor. Approaching the third floor, [[Delwath]] sees a big open space, maybe a library or study of some sort -- there are bookshelves, a large table, and, as [[Delwath]] comes towards the top of the stairs, a sparking blue arcane construct of some sort, looking like a frozen lightning bolt more than anything else, emerges from the wall. As [[Delwath]] turns to run down the stairs, it follows and sends a blasting arc of lightning at him, while [[Delwath]] dives out a window to escape. 

Struggling to his feet, [[Delwath]] returns to the group and reports on his experience, including hearing something whispering in his mind, asking him what he wanted to know as he approached the doorway. Asking it what [[Agata]] Dustmother wanted, he got the answer: “I see a power growing in the desert, I see it reaching out to betray the people of the plains. I see it wanting power above all, and revenge.” Thinking perhaps this is the same force as was behind the runes in the storm, the party takes a moment to rest and refresh while debating what to do next, and talking about runes and [[giants]].

As the sunset sets and the stars begin to come out during their brief rest, we end with the dawning realization that something is wrong with the night sky. The [[Fox and Hunter]], faithful companions in the stars, are missing...

Huddled by the side of a prominence of blue granite jutting out of the plains of [[Dunmar]], surrounded by a small calm spot in the howling storm, [[Kenzo]], [[Delwath]], [[Riswynn]], [[Seeker]], and [[Wellby]] contemplate the stars. Specifically, the fact that one of the most prominent constellations in the sky, the [[Fox and Hunter]], is missing, although the rest of the sky does not look much different from what you would expect.

After some puzzled conversation about the nature of time and the stars, [[Seeker]] recalls that he has read several studies of Dwarven scholars that, in other planes, and in particular the mirror realms, the echo realms that reflect and are like and yet unlike the world of Taelgar, time often runs differently. But whether this is such a place is not clear. 

Turning to the small camp, the party decides that the dead person buried under the sign of the [[The Sibyl]], the goddess of knowledge and magic, among other things, part of the Eightfold Way religion of [[Chardon]] and other places, would not mind being dug up under the circumstances. Despite sparks of lightning collecting on [[Wellby]] during the excavation, [[Seeker]] proceeds to move the earth and expose the body. This is a [[Alban|human male]] in early stages of decomposition, buried in a shroud but without much else. It is hard to infer much from this body, but the general impression of [[Kenzo]] at least is this is relatively modern style Chardonian clothing. So, with some uncertainty, the party concludes this is probably not someone from hundreds of years ago.

Meanwhile, [[Wellby]] has been trying to speak with the [[Stormcaller Tower|tower]], without much success, beyond a few scattered images: the tower, a large storm moving towards it, a man standing in robes on the platform, a flash of light, and blinding pain.

Deciding to climb the tower to the platform, [[Kenzo]] starts up with a rope, nearly falling before being stabilized by the guiding runes of [[Seeker]] directing his grasp. On the platform, he drops down a rope and the remainder of the party climbs up. On the platform jutting out from [[Stormcaller Tower]] is a pool of water, covering perhaps the most distant third of the platform, in a marble basin, and cascading over the edge of the platform into nothingness. Set on a marble pillar in the middle of the pool is a iron globe, made of bands of iron running in circles and crossing each other, almost like an armillary sphere. In the other direction, there is a wide archway leading into the white marble tower at the far end of the platform.

Caught in blowing gusts of wind, the party begins to explore. Trying to examine the globe more closely draws an attack from some kind of water creature that seems to be protecting the pool, appearing out of the basin and lunging, a water snake of sorts. By a combination of [[Riswynn]]’s ability to shape water, [[Delwath]]’s mage hand, and some careful maneuvering, the party is able to learn a few things about the globe, with [[Delwath]] being struck once by the water snake but avoiding being pulled underwater by using his oil of slipperness beforehand. The globe has Drankorian writing on it, some kind of fragment of an incantation of binding and control, very powerful, and is magical, with a complex enchantment containing hints of conjuration, enchantment, and illusion magic. 

Deciding to avoid trying to fight the water snake for now, as lightning crackles along the walls of the tower, and still unsure who or what [[Wellby]] has been telepathically communicating with, the party ventures into [[Stormcaller Tower]]. The room they enter is a large, white marble room, taking up nearly half the space in this floor, decorated only with five white marble pillars topped by empty silver sockets. Stairs to either side lead up and down. Through an archway into another room, there is a eight foot tall bust of a [[Hralgar|giant]], just the shoulders and head, carved in stone. The features are somewhat indistinct, with a flat nose, no hair, a long stretched out face, and elaborately decorated in gold and silver. Where the [[Hralgar's Eyes|eyes]] should be are instead empty sockets, looking like something was removed; similarly, there is a five-pointed stone crown on its head, each point topped with a silver setting, [[Binding Stones|empty]]. 

![[hralgar-statue.png|400]]
As the crackle of lightning increases, the party decides to head up the stairs, climbing through mist and fog, until they emerge, exiting the tower, onto the side of a rocky, barren mountain. Clouds obscure the land below, but ahead an enormous hall, many times human-sized, stands on the flattened top of the mountain. Large, booming footfalls are coming towards the party from within.

Everyone except [[Wellby]] hides as a giant emerges from the hall. Maybe 25 feet tall, dark gray skin, purple-ish hair tied in a topknot behind his head, dressed in fine silk robes, his appearance only marred by the fact that he is missing both his eyes. He stops on the enormous steps to sit in the sun when [[Wellby]] calls out to him. The giant in turn asks if he is here for omens and stories, and offers information in trade. In the ensuing conversation is becomes apparent that the giant, who’s name is [[Hralgar]], perceives [[Wellby]]’s tales of [[Raven's Hold]] and its history to be in the future, not the past. During the conversation, [[Hralgar]] informs them it is the year 5031 by the true reckoning of time, which would be towards the end of the [[Drankorian Empire]] if this matches Dwarven reckoning of time. 

[[Hralgar]] offers [[Wellby]] a story in exchange for his tale, and [[Wellby]] eventually begins describing [[Stormcaller Tower]] and asks [[Hralgar]] for information about the storm and the tower. [[Hralgar]] is distrubed, describing the tower as a place he knows, a place he passed by as a storm once, the place where a wizard lives or lived, a wizard named [[Eudomes]], a Drankorian. [[Stormcaller Tower]] itself is far older, Elvish in construction, but long abandoned until the Drankorians re-inhabited it. [[Hralgar]] would occasionally speak and trade with [[Eudomes]], passing across the plains as a great storm. [[Eudomes]] once told him he had a great omen to trade; [[Hralgar]] traveled as the wind across the plains, watching the cities below. But he cannot remember more, and seems puzzled and confused by the fact that he cannot see, and cannot find his eyes, and does not believe there is a stairway to the tower from here. 

As [[Hralgar]] becomes increasing agitated and confused, it slowly dawns on the party that they may not have ever left the tower. As they discuss freeing [[Hralgar]], and ask him how he would leave, he gets down on his knees, feeling for the supposed stairs, a chain starts to appear around his wrist, his arm pulled and slammed into the floor behind him, as the mountain fades. 

On the top floor of the tower the giant [[Hralgar]] is chained to the floor, in an enormous room that takes up the entire space of the floor. The ceiling, perhaps once a beautiful glass, is shattered and open to the night sky above. [[Hralgar]], in pain but seemingly clear-headed, recounts the events leading up to his capture: the wizard [[Eudomes]] and others like him falling out with the Emperor of [[Drankor]], but had received omens of a great plague and the fall of [[Drankor]]. Whether wanting to stop it, or profit from it, or just use the power of [[Hralgar]] to protect themselves, they lured him to [[Stormcaller Tower]] and bound him with ancient, powerful magics. 

[[Hralgar]] himself only became conscious a month ago, and says he could free himself if only he could see. The party hypothesizes that perhaps [[Society of the Open Scroll]] treasure hunters came here, took the gems from the statue, and awakened [[Hralgar]], which then set off the storm. Deciding to at least explore the rest of the tower, perhaps learn more about [[Eudomes]], [[Hralgar]], the events at the end of the [[Drankorian Empire]], and how to free this giant, the party prepares to head out, while [[Hralgar]] warns them to hurry, as he is not sure how long he can keep his mind clear.

Standing in a shattered room at the top of an [[Stormcaller Tower|ancient tower]], we begin with our heroes confronting a massive [[Giants|storm giant]], laying chained and manacled to the ground in front of them. Clothed in tattered robes, with long, shaggy hair and weathered features, the most notable fact about this storm giant, [[Hralgar]], is that he is missing his [[Hralgar's Eyes|eyes]]. 

During a brief conversation, the party learns the giant first came to consciousness about a month ago, and has been trapped here, drifting in and out of waking dreams ever since. When he awoke his eyes were gone and his conscious grip on his mind was weak, although since he has had moments of lucidity, such as now. He tells the party that he believes he could free himself if his eyes were returned to him, and that when he loses conscious control of his mind he cannot prevent the tower from drifting in his dangerous dreams, where the part of his consciousness lost in the storm outside controls the present and his thoughts return to a simpler time, when he lived on his mountaintop palace trading stories and omens with travelers. Noting that while they are talking with [[Hralgar]], the constellation of the [[Fox and Hunter]] is back in the sky, the party realizes that its absence is a sign they have drifted back into the dreams of [[Hralgar]]. 

At this point, the party splits up. [[Kenzo]] remains with [[Hralgar]], entering a state of meditation with him and reaching out to his soul, trying to hold his conscious mind in the present and comfort him as much as possible. The rest of the party heads down the stairs to search the tower, to try to see if they can uncover any clues about who took [[Hralgar]]’s eyes (although they already are developing a theory it was Chardonian adventurers).

As [[Riswynn]], [[Seeker]], [[Delwath]], and [[Wellby]] start to explore [[Stormcaller Tower]], it is obvious there are signs that it has been looted already, presumably by the people who made the camp and buried a companion. The statue of the bust of the giant, with empty eye sockets, has had something recently removed from around the crown on its head, and presumably the eye sockets as well. [[Wellby]] finds three pairs of footprints in the dust on the stairs up to this level. And when the party makes it down the next floor to the library, most of the obvious loose books have been taken (although some could have been taken long ago, of course). 

In the library, [[Delwath]] discovered three books that are still attached by chains to the shelf, and cannot be easily freed in the little time the party has, so he sits down to read what he can. The books are fascinating -- one, in Giant, called “[[Tales Before the Fall]]”, stories of the giants from the Age of Creation, two more, in Hkarian, one “[[On the Ordering of Giants]]”, another “[[Journeys of Souls]].” 

While [[Delwath]] reads, the rest of the party continues to explore, save [[Kenzo]] who remains in meditation with the giant. On the same floor as the library, the other side of the tower is an amazing room, a wind garden of sorts, protected from the elements on one side by intricate marble netting filling the space of several large windows. The floor is a rainbow swirl of different hues and colors, that seem to shift and change in response to the wind, and around the room stone benches of different minerals provide a place to sit and enjoy the artistry. 

[[Seeker]] and [[Wellby]] then continue to the second floor, while [[Riswynn]] searches the destroyed first floor. On the second floor, three small bedchambers have clearly been looted haphazardly; in the third, wedged in a small desk are a couple of old letters and a pile of papers. The papers are receipts and bills from the business of the tower; the letters read as follows:

"Tell [[Eudomes]] that we will arrive in two weeks time. We expect to speak to the captured being, whom you call [[Hralgar]]. The [[Occulta Ludum]] will be overjoyed to hear the binding seems to have worked, but tell [[Eudomes]] to be cautious above all else, keep this secret. Giants are dangerous in all their forms, even to us, and binding a storm giant at the peak of their power is the most dangerous business of all."

"I hope this message finds you alive. You all must flee west as quickly as possible. There is no time to worry about [[Hralgar]]. Head west: [[Chardon]] may be safe. A plague of great magical power has struck, the Emperor is already dead, several Magistri teleported to safety but where they have gone is unknown. [[Drankor]] has fallen and the east is in chaos. I fear the danger is spreading quickly, and this may be the end of us all."

On the floor is also a door that will not open.

The first floor, searched by [[Riswynn]], is only moderately enlightening, clearly the ruins of what was a main hall, a pantry/storeroom, and a kitchen. 

After a brief discussion about the history of [[Stormcaller Tower]], revealed in pieces by [[Hralgar]] and the notes found in the secretary’s chamber, [[Delwath]] decides to teleport into the locked room. Once inside, he finds a relatively intact bedchamber of a wizard, presumably [[Eudomes]]. After a brief search turns up a few notable items -- a [[Goggles of Object Reading|pair of goggles with purple gem lenses]], a [[The Mirror of the Past|magic mirror]], some coins and art -- [[Seeker]] shrinks the door to give [[Delwath]] a chance to exit and [[Wellby]] an opportunity for a brief search.

At this point, feeling they have learned all they can and looted as much as is possible from the tower, the party reconvenes on the wind platform over the plains to possibly do something about the iron globe. Meanwhile, [[Kenzo]] continues to journey with [[Hralgar]]’s mind, attempting to build a mental anchor for [[Hralgar]]’s consciousness to hold onto. 

On the wind platform, some clever wrangling manages to dislodge the iron sphere, angering the water guardian who sends a number of steam and dust creatures to attack the party. Although the party is able to defeat them mostly unscathed, feeling the danger level increasingly they quickly depart, pulling the iron sphere onto the ground below, where is lies, inert. Feeling the giant’s mind slipping away, and warned by [[Kenzo]] that time is short, the party finally decides to flee [[Stormcaller Tower]].

However, it seems they have left it a bit too long, and as they leave thunder cracks and the [[Fox and Hunter]] fades from the sky, and darkness falls, suppressing even the magical light of the [[Driftglobe|driftglobes]] As the party hurries away from the tower, the darkness, mists and fog close in, making a straight path impossible. Hours later, they stumble out into the morning sun, exhausted, having wandered in the confusing mists of the storm all night. As dawn breaks, they stumble, exhausted, into the clear light of day. After some brief conversation and goodbyes to [[Vola]], who is heading to [[Chardon]], and [[Riswynn]], who is heading home to [[Tharn Todor]] with the Brawnanvil clan artifacts she reclaimed, the party sits down to a brief rest and breakfast while considering their next move.

Bone tired from a night of stumbling through the mists, fog, rain, and thunder of [[Hralgar]]’s storm, we open on the party, resting over a late breakfast, [telling stories of their childhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6k6EcUUBuQ). [[Seeker]], about his brother [[Frankar]] who vanished after an accident with a strange divination machine of his invention; [[Delwath]], about cooking for his elders as rumors of darkness spread in the world outside; [[Kenzo]], about the hard life of poor street kids growing up in [[Chardon]]; and [[Wellby]], about being at home on the road and the stories his great-grandfather told. As these stories finish, the conversation turns to the events of the past month, as the party starts to puzzle over the mysteries they have experienced, and speculate on answers. [[Seeker]] records much of the conversation in his journal, and a few answers perhaps emerge.

Turning south to [[Karawa]], an exhausted party decides to get a few hours walking in before breaking to rest. This first leg of the trip is briefly interrupted by an emaciated band of gnolls, many of whom seem to have begun consuming themselves out of lack of suitable prey. They are quickly dispatched, as the party holds their ground and rains arrows and magic down on the gnolls, charging across the plains at them.

The next seven days are relatively uneventful, as the party journeys south across the plains. The land gradually dries, turning from grassland to scrub to rocky desert with only scattered vegetation over the course of the journey, while [[Seeker]] maps ley lines and fiddles with the lenses [[Delwath]] found in [[Stormcaller Tower]], and [[Wellby]] trains his pet axe beak. Camped outside of [[Karawa]], the party spends some time contemplating the situation. Realizing the mirror of [[Eudomes]] can be used to look into the past, [[Delwath]] holds up the [[Ivory Scroll Cap]] they found to the [[The Mirror of the Past|mirror]] and [[Ivory Scroll Cap Vision|asks to see its past]], when it was created and when it was used.

The next day, the party arrives at [[Karawa]] by mid-afternoon. From a distance, it is clear that the town has suffered greatly. [[Ikram’s]] the popular caravanserai and site of many early meetings, is mostly destroyed and burned, as are the small shops nearby, including [[Delwath]]’s apartment. The shade trees around the oasis square have been chopped down and some burned, and many houses are smashed and now open to the elements. As the party approaches, the [[Centaurs|centaur]] [[Tharandros]] and the Dunmari warrior [[Havdar]] ride up, and greet them with pleasure. [[Alesh]] and [[Candrosa]] are waiting in the outbuildings of the Temple, with news to share and receive.

[[Candrosa]] is surprised and happy to see the party -- the [[Centaurs]] have not informed him that it was [[Kenzo]], [[Delwath]], [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and [[Riswynn]] who convinced them to go south. [[Candrosa]] looks exhausted and worn out, and gives a brief update on what has happened. Many days ago, a large band of gnolls attacked, burned the town, and lay siege to the Temple. The siege was broken by the arrival of the [[Centaurs]] a little more than a week ago, who crushed the gnoll lines, albeit not without casualties, and freed the [[Shakun Mystai]] sheltering in the temple. Some days later, [[Alesh]] returned, as did [[Havdar]] with some of his troops from [[Tokra]]. 

[[Alesh]] then reports on her scouting journey into the blasted plains. They passed by [[Kharsan]], which seemed haunted but also deserted, at least by day, and full of nightmares of a choking red mist at night. South of [[Kharsan]], they encountered an emaciated gnoll band, about half of which seemed more [[undead]] than alive, heading south and west into the [[Garamjala Desert]]. They did not follow them far into the desert, as they were not adequately supplied for such a journey, but they noted that a raven also seemed to be following the gnolls. 

[[Alesh]] also reported two other odd findings. First, on the edge of the desert, a [[Pava and Avaras' House|stone house]], clean and neat, but empty except for the usual trappings of a house, a small chest, chickens and goats and feed for them, and a seemingly magical well. Second, they saw an [[Orcs|orc]] scouting party, which struck them as odd as [[Orcs|orcs]] are not usually very organized and discrete, preferring a straightforward charge. 

Finally, before the party begins to report on the events of the north, [[Kenzo]] asks about [[Agata]] Dustmother. Neither [[Candrosa]] or [[Alesh]] has heard that name, but [[Candrosa]] mentions the [[Agata|Old Woman of the Dusts]], an old woman who lives in the desert, and who has some kind of magic. But not a pleasant kind of magic, rather it is the [[Story about Hags|sort of magic that comes at a price]], often a large one, and that you only turn to when you are desperate and willing to give up everything. 

The session ends with [[Candrosa]] finishing this story, and everyone wondering if this is indeed [[Agata]] Dustmother.

We open in a bare room, the party, [[Candrosa]], and [[Alesh]] clustered around a map, discussing the gnolls, what [[Alesh]] found in the south, the events at [[Raven's Hold]], and [[Agata]] Dustmother. The conversation is wide-ranging, touching on many subjects.

The dark magic of [[Agata]], also known as the [[Agata|Old Woman of the Dusts]], is discussed, and how she makes deals that always seem to turn out worse, and darker than expected. So are demons, and how they have little power to reach the world of Taelgar, unless summoned, opening up a portal to allow them through to wreck havoc. While not common these days, many demons fought in the [[Great War]], aiding the armies of [[Cha'mutte]]. 

No one is sure where the gnolls to the south came from -- whether there is another demon there, making more gnolls -- but [[Alesh]] points out that it would be possible for them to have traveled south from [[Raven's Hold]] in the blasted plain. That raises more questions, though, like why they were heading to [[Kharsan]] and then into the desert. 

Throughout the conversation, [[Candrosa]] is distracted, worried, and nervous, and when the topic of conversation steers towards [[Shakun]]’s protection and its absence, he becomes silent and refuses to discuss further. The only time he speaks with force and vigor is when [[Delwath]] suggests there is nothing left of value in [[Karawa]] to besiege it for, as the land has been overrun already, and [[Candrosa]] corrects him that the [[Temple of Shakun]] has never fallen. As he leaves to pray, he seems shaken, and overwhelmed.

Before leaving, he tells the party the tales of how to find [[Agata]], should they wish it: head east to the eastern edge of the [[Red Mesa|mesa]], then turn south, and look for an animal behaving strangely: a crow flying due south, a line of black beetles, a lizard moving slowly and watching. Follow that animal, and it will lead you to [[Agata]]’s home.

After some discussion of what to do next, and a brief conversation with [[Havdar]], who is angling for the party to come east hunting [[Orcs]] and gnolls with him, the group heads to find [[Tharandros]], the leader of the [[Centaurs]]. [[Tharandros]] is happy to speak with them at length, over food and wine, as he is overjoyed that they removed the demonic corruption from the land.

Another wide-ranging conversation occurs, touching on the echo realms (the [[Shadowfell]], [[Feywild]], [[Nightmare Realm]], [[Dreamworld]], and perhaps many more), the resonances in the world that they are echos and reflections of, and the mythic history of the days of great magic before the echo realms were created by [[The Riving]], which sundered some of the chaos of Taelgar. From [[Tharandros]], the party learned that [[Agata]] is a fey creature, and that she and the [[Centaurs]] had an agreement that she would stay south of the road, in the desert and canyonlands, while the [[Centaurs]] would have the plains to the north. He also hinted she may have been an ally of [[Cha'mutte]] in the [[Great War]], and this is the cause of her desire for revenge.

Finally, the conversation returns to [[Karawa]] and the [[Shakun]] mysteries. [[Tharandros]] says there is something wrong here, a silence where their should be echoes and reverberations, something missing from the land, and asks the party if they can find out more. As the conversation ends, the party decides that perhaps the answers they seek lie to the east, and prepare to find [[Havdar]] to discuss joining forces.

Having decided to leave [[Karawa]] for the deserts and the blasted plain to the east, traveling with [[Havdar]] and his band, the party spends a few days taking care of business in [[Karawa]]. You find a place to store the loot you are not planning on taking into the desert; [[Candrosa]] offers space in the outbuildings of the [[Temple of Shakun]], where it will hopefully remain safe. Each time you see him he seems as if he is wrestling with a decision, but with the preparations for the expedition you don’t have time to speak in more depth with him.

You speak with [[Havdar]], and make a plan to head south to [[Bas Udda]] and then east to a spot he knows that can provide shelter and water, to set up a base camp for further scouting. [[Havdar]] believes as long as there are not more than 100 [[Orcs]], he and his band, with your aid, can defeat them; if there are more, flight will be the only option. 

The morning of April 27th, just before you depart [[Karawa]], [[Kenzo]] [[Kenzo's Jade Vision|slips off for a bit]], as does [[Delwath]], followed by [[Wellby]]. Then, you set out with [[Havdar]]’s troop into the desert. The journey is uneventful for two days, as you get into a rhythm of traveling in the morning, pausing for a few hours in the heat of the day, and then traveling until past dark. [[Havdar]]’s troop is an efficient group, and moves quickly.

The morning of the third day, you arrive in [[Bas Udda]] some time before noon, intending to spend the hot part of the day resting here, and investigating the situation. The town is in ruins -- few buildings are standing, and the wreckage is far worse than the ruins of [[Karawa]]. There are also signs of many dead: there are bodies laid out, as if to be buried or burned, with some care, and seemingly freshly prepared. This has attracted the attention of some giant vultures, who move in to attempt to drive off the party and [[Havdar]]’s band. While one manages to snatch [[Wellby]], they are killed and driven off by the quick action of the party and [[Havdar]]. 

Upon ending the vulture threat, the party enters the Temple, which appears to have been recently cleaned and is one of the more intact buildings in the town. Here, they find a young man cowering from the vultures, among what appear to be hundreds of small idols to the gods, collected from the dead. They learn that this is [[Amil]], a young Dunmari monk, part of an order that has as its mission putting to rest the lost souls of the blasted plains. He is here to help send the souls of the unburied dead into the next world, so they can be at peace. He is particularly a devotee of [[Bhishma]], the human founder of [[Dunmar]], its first ruler and queen, who has since seemed to achieve some divine powers. He tells you that [[Bhishma]] watches over the souls of all her people, and her [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Mystery cult]] is devoted to helping with this mission. He is training with two monks who live on the edge of the desert, in a small stone house. Upon seeing [[Delwath]], he is taken aback, as his masters [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]] found an [[Elves]] in the [[Nashtkar|blasted plain]] six months back. 

Taking this as a sign, the party decides to enlist the aid of [[Havdar]]’s band in helping [[Amil]] finish his work in [[Bas Udda]], and then part company with [[Havdar]] to travel to the stone house of [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]]. It takes the rest of the day and the first part of the morning to find, bless and lay to rest the remaining bodies of the dead Dunmari, but with [[Havdar]]’s warriors helping dig through the ruins it goes quickly. [[Havdar]] and his band give [[Wellby]] careful directions to where they intend to set a base camp, and then depart, while the party leaves with [[Amil]] towards the [[Pava and Avaras' House|stone house]]. 

The party leaves [[Bas Udda]] the afternoon of April 30th, and that afternoon and the next day are uneventful. On the next day, May 2nd, they expect to arrive in the afternoon. While traveling down a canyon to a shaded spring that [[Amil]] knows, hoping to spend the noon hours resting in the shade, they notice something is not right. [[Wellby]] goes ahead to scout, and finds three ogres sleeping in the sun, but manages to accidentally wake one. As he begins to negotiate, the orge instead decides that a [[Halflings|halfling]] would be a good snack, and begins to chase [[Wellby]] back to the party. In the ensuing battle, the ogres are dispatched with only some minor difficulty. 

The session ends with the party arriving at the [[Pava and Avaras' House|stone house]], [[Amil]] running ahead to tell his masters who is here, and [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]] standing outside to greet them.---

## Narrative
[[Seeker]] of Highkeep, [[Wellby]] Goodbarrel, [[Kenzo]], and [[Delwath]], arriving at the [[Gomat]] Oasis past sunset, tired and weary from a long journey in the desert sun, find the oasis beset by three giant lizards, feasting on dead sheep. Deciding to attack, the party made relatively quick work of the beasts. Exhausted, and unable to determine much in the dark, the party camped for the night.

In the morning, exploring the oasis, they found signs of a battle and clear tracks of the giant lizards heading east, into the wilderness. While dissecting the lizards in search of clues to their particularly vicious and bloodthirsty behavior, an older man, wounded but alive, appeared on the horizon on horseback. Hailing him, the party learned that he was [[Akan]], one of the survivors of the giant lizard attack on [[Gomat]] the night before. His extended family had been camped at the oasis, grazing their herds, for several days, intending to rest and relax before the [[Festival of Rebirth]]. In the afternoon, the lizards attacked. They tried to fight them off, and managed to kill one while fleeing, but the lizards were relentless and would not be scared away, and several members of [[Akan]]’s family were killed before all could get on horseback to flee. He had returned to reclaim supplies -- food and water and the like -- before heading to [[Karawa]]. Before departing, his nephew headed north and west to warn others to get to town as quickly as possible. 

The party, however, headed east. Traveling and talking during the long hot day, they followed the trade road due east. Along the way, they noticed the rotting corpses of several dead peccaries just off the road, killed in the past few days, with obvious signs of lizard tracks. Some were consumed, but others just left to rot -- very unusual behavior for giant lizards. 

In the late afternoon, they came to wide canyon ripped into the earth. [[Seeker]] especially was taken by how unnatural the landscape seemed, both the rugged badlands to the south, and the canyon itself, which clearly was not formed by the usual processes of gradual erosion. Descending the slope was easy enough to start, but a basalt outcropping about three quarters of the way down stopped them for the evening. 

Returning in the morning after [[Seeker]] magically created a doorless earthen barn for [[Delwath]]’s horse, the party made their way slowly down to the bottom of the canyon. Here, it became apparent that many animal tracks crossed and criss-crossed the terrain, all converging in the east on a sloping side canyon leading up to the remains of the trade road. Following the path, the party stood on the other side of the canyon, where the entire landscape seemed bloodthirsty and enraged. Ants and scorpions swarming the ground, the remains of a battle between a giant scorpion and a giant hyena -- everywhere they turned something was attacking something else. 

In the distance, two towers, the gatehouse to a ruined fort, drew them in. Approaching the fort, the party saw before them a path leading to an earthenworks dike, upon which was set a ruined wall, with the two partially intact towers guarding the gate and causeway leading into the fort. Outside the walls were the foundations of a small cluster of buildings, all collapsed, and two large mounds -- on the left, a grassy mound, on the right, one of rubble and dirt. Passing the mound, [[Kenzo]] felt something evil, an undead presence, and shouted a warning just as a skeletal hand began reaching out of the dirt. Four skeletons climbed out of the disturbed ground and attacked, although were dispatched without much damage as the party discovered newfound abilities within themselves. 

After the battle, searching the area revealed clear indications that the skeleton mound had been recently disturbed, in the past month or so at least, and [[Wellby]] noticed signs that someone had been around in that time frame. [[Seeker]], with his historical knowledge, identified the fort as likely dating to the [[Great War]], being a typical Dunmari layout and design at that time. 

With that, the party headed up the causeway to the fort, ready for anything.

We begin at the entrance to [[Pava and Avaras' House]] in the desert, with these two old monks greeting the party, and [[Delwath]] especially with recognition and a note of caution. They welcome the group into their home, and over cool mint tea tell the story of how they found [[Delwath]], wandering, delirious in the desert, dying of thirst, perhaps 30 miles east of their home. He was muttering in a language they did not know, and looked wild, but not willing to leave him to die they brought him to their home. 

Over the course of the afternoon and early evening, while their student [[Amil]] brings tea, [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]] tell their story, and listen to the party. They have lived here for nearly 30 years, and were wanderers for some time before that, and once the desert was, if not exactly safe, much more empty than it is now. They tell of [[Bhishma]], the founder and first Samraat ruler of the Dunmari, whose prayers brought [[Jeevali]] back to life (the event celebrated by the [[Festival of Rebirth]]). Their order is dedicated to her -- she is now deified, as a demigod in the pantheon of the Dunmari -- and has a mission to care for the lost dead and tell the stories of the people of [[Dunmar]]. But they are cautious and not very forthcoming, and ask to hear the party’s story.

As the party is talking, [[Avaras]] appears with the reason for their suspicion: [[Delwath]]’s old [[Elven Shadow Breastplate|elven armor]], now collecting shadows that grow and billow off of it. When [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]] found [[Delwath]], they were worried the shadows were making him delirious, were cursing or contaminating him somehow. As [[Delwath]] puts on the armor, the shadows fade, and a look of acceptance settles on his face. As the conversation continues, [[Avaras]] and [[Pava]], and the party, come to be convinced the shadows are not evil, and the armor belongs with [[Delwath]]. 

After this, the conversation continues, touching on [[Agata]] Dustmother (“misery incarnate” according to [[Pava]]), and especially the history of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Mystai of Bhisma]]. For some time, even before [[Avaras]] and [[Pava]] were born, the order they eventually joined had become deeply committed to trying to cleanse the land, the [[Plaguelands|desolation of Cha’mutte]], of some evil preventing it from healing. About 30 years ago, one of their leaders supposedly devised a secret way to remove this curse, and it was attempted. But it didn’t work, and many of the strongest in their order died, and much power and knowledge was lost, including the original [[Monastery of Bhishma]] near [[Kharsan]]. As it was inside the cursed area of plague nightmares around [[Kharsan]] it was never exactly safe to approach, and after the failure 30 years ago few were left with the power to dare it.

Now, in the past year or so, they speak of how things have changed, gotten much more dangerous. [[Orcs]] who used to live peacefully to the east are now fighting each other in some kind of civil war; a malevolent presence now seems to direct the evil memories that linger around [[Kharsan]]; and an adventuring party passed east into the desert recently, chasing rumors of a lost library of [[Drankor]] to the south. As the party discussed [[Delwath]]’s past and powers, [[Avaras]] and [[Pava]] go to bustle about in the kitchen cooking dinner. 

The next day, they spend the morning training with [[Pava]], who shows [[Kenzo]] a trick to manipulate his opponents’ ki and stun them. The party then sets out in the afternoon for [[Havdar]]’s camp, about a day’s join to the northeast. Passing through the canyonlands and rough terrain it is obvious how much better [[Wellby]] has become at picking a path through the desert, and the party makes steady progress into the evening. 

The next day, after avoiding a giant scorpion lying in wait to ambush some prey, and after traveling most of the day, the party stops as they approach [[Havdar]]’s camp and hear sounds of a battle ahead. [[Seeker]] looks ahead using one of his new spells, and sees [[Havdar]] fighting a large band of [[Orcs]], maybe 20 or more. The party leaps into action, and finds themselves facing off against the leader of the band and several spellcasters, including one who causes some serious damage with a giant blast of fire. But the tide of battle eventually turns against the [[Orcs]], and the session ends with the [[Orcs]] dead, except for one who is unconscious in the grasp of a large stone hand summoned by [[Seeker]].

We begin as the battle with the [[Orcs|orcs]] ends, the party collecting themselves after a tough fight, and deciding to deal with their captive, one of the [[Orcs|orc]] clerics named [[Gorkil]]. There is little to note among the wreckage of the battle, although the party does take note of the symbol that seems to be painted on these orc faces and gear: a rising sun, below a screaming face. 

Heading into [[Havdar]]’s camp, they speak briefly with [[Havdar]], and [[Aram]], a holy warrior and healer of [[Aagir]]. [[Havdar]] lost four of his warriors in the fight, which was tougher and more deadly than expected, both because of the sophistication of the [[Orcs]] battle plan and their magic. 

As they prepare to interrogate the [[Orcs|orc]], [[Aram]] touches him to revive him. The [[Orcs|orc]] is a servant of [[Grash]], the Blighted One, whom he believes will bring him back ten times stronger if he dies. He rants continually on [[Grash]]’s power and how if you serve [[Grash]], you will never die, and the battle is not yet over, which prompts the party to suggest that the bodies of the [[Orcs]] be burned. As [[Havdar]] leaves to take care of that task, the party continues their questioning. They learn that [[Grash]] is in [[Kharsan]], and that the [[Orcs]] found him perhaps a year ago. [[Grash]] demands that they seek treasure and tribute, especially that they seek to take the treasure of the other group of [[Orcs]], [[Uzgash]]’s brats [[Gorkil]] calls them, dismissively. He says they ([[Uzgash]]’s brats) are peaceful, farming and raising animals, although where exactly he does not say. As the interrogation continues, [[Gorkil]] suddenly demands that [[Seeker]] kill him, adding a magical command to his voice that compels [[Seeker]] to lunge forward and cut his throat. 

After some conversation about where to go next, [[Havdar]] returns to tell the party they are ready for the funeral of the four who died in the battle, and asks if the party would join them. The bodies are burned -- with care, not in a pile like the [[Orcs]] -- and both [[Aram]] and [[Havdar]] speak a few words. After, [[Havdar]] approaches the party with the [[Flaming Bowstring|magical bowstring]] used by [[Camana]], the leader of [[Havdar]]’s scouts who died in the battle, and asks [[Wellby]] if he would like the magical bowstring, which can light arrows on fire as they launch. 

The next day, after hearing from [[Havdar]]’s returning scouts that there is little moving in the lands west of the [[Kharja]] river (the river which [[Kharsan]] is on), the party decides to head for the [[Monastery of Bhishma]], traveling south some distance before turning east and north, hoping to approach from the south and avoid [[Kharsan]] entirely. The journey through the desert is several days of walking under the hot sun, everything brown and dry at the end of the long dry season before the brief summer thunderstorms arrive. Traveling quickly for the first two days carries them far south, and a bit further west than intended, so it takes a bit longer to reach the dry river and turn north than expected.

Five days after leaving [[Havdar]]’s troops, the party arrives at the [[Kharja]] river, briefly considering scouting what appears to be a stand of trees far to the south, but instead turns north to their destination. The river bed is dry, with cliffs on the western edge and a floodplain on the eastern edge, and after a hot journey the party arrives within sight of [[Kharsan]] in the late afternoon of May 11th. 

The city of [[Kharsan]] stretches out on the floodplains, a walled city at least a mile across, once a place of great monumental architecture, but now partially in ruins. A huge temple, a stadium, and a palace in the center of the city are notable surviving landmarks, as are the bridge over the river and the main gates to the city, a pair of horses rearing to form an archway. On the cliffs above the city and across the river, twelve tombs stand, all sharing a pentagonal step pyramid design, but otherwise different in form and scale. These are the tombs of the rulers of the [[Aatmaji Dynasty|first Dunmari dynasty]], starting with the tomb of [[Bhishma]] (marked by a large -- 40’ tall -- statue of her). South of the city, an [[Orcs|orc]] fort is under construction, a warren and maze of walls and enclosed spaces. Further south beyond that is the monastery, seemingly untouched. ---

We begin around noon at camp, about 5 miles south of the [[Monastery of Bhishma]], as [[Wellby]] returns from scouting as a desert hawk. The party is just finishing their usual midday rest, in the shade of the canyon walls along the dry river, and deciding what to do next. First, though, [[Kenzo]] tells them about [[Rai]], the [[Heroes of the Great War]], and [[Kenzo]]’s possible connection, via the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]] he carries, to [[Rai]], and the fact that the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], who [[Rai]] told [[Kenzo]] to seek, is also the [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Mysteries of Bhishma]]. The discussion turns to more recent history, and pondering again what could have happened thirty years ago that nearly destroyed the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]] and left their monastery abandoned. 

After some discussion of the past, the party turns to [[Wellby]]’s scouting report and map. They decide that during the heat of the day, while everything is quiet, may be a better time to explore than dusk, and so head for the monastery. Making a small camp and leaving horses and gear at the foot of the cliffs, the party heads around the bend in the river to approach the monastery from the west. 

As the party scouts the monastery, passing through the gardens and slopes leading down the river, [[Wellby]], scouting ahead, hears the sounds of evil childlike laughter and what might be a sleeping lion’s soft growling coming from a large one story building ahead. Deciding to scout invisibly, [[Delwath]] goes through the kitchens, and [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] look through the crumbling wall. In the large common room and dining area of the monastery, two large creatures -- with the body of lions, leathery wings, and humanoid faces -- are sleeping, while smaller young are taunting each other. 

After some debate, the party decides they cannot let the manticores live, as they will be a threat to [[Baxter]] and the horses if they wake up and go hunting. They concoct a plan to drop a [[Driftglobe|driftglobe]] while invisible to lure the little ones away, then surprise the parents. Although they start with some bad luck, the combination of [[Seeker]]’s metal heat heating and searing one of the manticores, and a well placed, if very loud, shatter spell makes relatively quick work of the beasts. While they don’t have any treasure to speak of, the bones and refuse in their lair does contain some relatively fresh gnoll skeletons. 

The very loud sounds of the battle draw the attention of an [[Orcs|orc]] patrol, who had been resting in the nearby bathhouse, out of the sun. [[Seeker]] enlarges [[Kenzo]], and between the giant monk and [[Delwath]]’s usual skill with the sword, the [[Orcs]] are dispatched without much danger. As the last surviving [[Orcs|orc]] turns to flee, a well-placed suggestion from [[Seeker]] compels him to surrender and talk to save his life. 

From the [[Orcs|orc]] captive, the party learns that the only other creatures in this complex that he is aware of are the ghosts, who keep the [[Orcs]] from entering the tower or the [[Hall of Stories]]. The [[Orcs]] feed the manticores occasionally, but otherwise all is pretty quiet. They come for a few days to keep watch and report anything suspicious to [[Grash]]; this war band is due to be relieved tomorrow afternoon. According to this [[Orcs|orc]] anyway, [[Grash's Horde|Grash's armies]] are strong and will defeat [[People of the Rainbow|Uzgash’s bastards]], who are somewhere to the south, soon. As the spell ends and the [[Orcs|orc]] turns angry and hostile, the party leaves him locked in the bathhouse, with the doors barred from the outside.

Returning to the dining hall that was the manticore’s lair, the party examines the large door in the far wall, painted with images of [[Bhishma]] and the words, “Let those who would enter my presence and accept my grace kneel before me and offer their prayers.” As [[Kenzo]] kneels and prays, the door swings open, revealing an antechamber of sorts, undisturbed by [[Orcs]] or beasts but worn down by time. A wardrobe holds rotting robes, and a chest contains holy water. The room reminds [[Kenzo]] of the preparation for initiation into the [[Lakan Mystai]], with the robes and holy water especially. 

Proceeding through another small room into a long corridor, the lights go out and all is dark for a moment, until, down the hallway, a scene on the wall is illuminated, a large group of people, carrying all their worldly possessions, pulling carts and livestock, fleeing from some tangled mass of darkness. You can feel the wind in your hair, and remember the feeling, the ache of leaving home and having to flee to new lands. Sensing a choice as to whether to continue down this path into the mysteries of [[Bhishma]], or turn back, [[Seeker]] and [[Kenzo]] choose to continue and experience the [[Order of the Awakened Soul Initiation|ritual of initiation to Bhishma's myseries]], while [[Wellby]] and [[Delwath]] turn back to the entry room to wait.---

We begin as [[Seeker]] and [[Kenzo]] return to the dining hall where [[Delwath]] and [[Wellby]] have been resting and waiting. [[Kenzo]] looks pale, and is barely walking, leaning on [[Seeker]] and stumbling as they emerge from the hallway. [[Kenzo]] and [[Seeker]] tell the story of the initiation rite: following the hallway, the story of [[Bhishma]] was gradually revealed, from her perspective, using a combination of visuals and sense-impressions of feelings and memories of, seemingly, [[Bhishma]] herself. The passage told the story of the Dunmari arriving in what is now [[Dunmar]], finding it desolate by the curse that ended the [[Drankorian Empire]], and despairing and starving. Then, being saved by [[Jeevali]], who sacrificed herself to cleanse the land, and then [[Bhishma]]’s sacrifice. In the end, there was one question: would you sacrifice yourself for [[Jeevali]]? While [[Kenzo]] answered yes, and died, [[Seeker]] answered no, and awoke, briefly panicking until [[Kenzo]] was brought back and opened his eyes, weak but alive. 

In the afterglow of this initiation, [[Kenzo]] asked [[Bhishma]] about [[Shakun]], and the message he saw was: “She ([[Shakun]]) is here with me ([[Bhishma]]). As always. But cannot reach [[Karawa]]. Something has been taken that should be there. Something that helps her reach the world. Find it and bring it back.” This was accompanied by an image of a [[Heart of Shakun|red ochre stone heart]], rough hewn from rock like that of the [[Red Mesa]] in [[Karawa]]. 

While [[Wellby]] explores the dormitories and the outbuildings -- discovering they are workshops for making paper, especially paper that can take enchantments -- [[Kenzo]] rests and recovers a bit. The party then sets out for the tower and the [[Hall of Stories]].

The doors to the [[Hall of Stories]] are protected by magic, and the tower is guarded by ghostly warriors. But when [[Kenzo]] approaches, making the sign of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Mystai of Bhishma]], they recognize him and let the party pass. They died fighting, but cannot remember their names or much of what has happened since.

The party proceeds through the tower, passing the library and study on the first floor, to the [[Hall of Stories]]. It is a vast open room, the ceiling supported by columns reaching three stories high and carved with many, many names, light shining from the windows set high on the walls. For a brief moment, the room is clear, but then the room itself fades, and the party is taken into the memories of the stories of Dunmari:

- First, via a brief memory of [[Seeker]] as a young dwarf, studying, a memory of a acolyte of the monastery preparing for initiation, studying in the library and then proceeding to the hall of initiation
  
- Then, via [[Delwath]]’s memory of the last battle he fought before he vanished to the shadow realm, everybody dead but him, to a monk, fighting a horde of undead, 30, 40, 50 skeletal creatures in front of the tower, his companions falling around him, then feeling the killing blow, but also the determination in your soul that the monastery will not fall, and rising from your body as a ghost to strike down the invaders
  
- Then, via [[Seeker]]’s memory of the moment of discovering [[Frankar|his brother’s]] divination that led to his disappearance, the sense of hidden magic and knowledge, a vision of an apprentice monk with two masters, in a building with a large domed roof, a small lizard-like winged creature with faded purple scales flying towards you, then a voice speaking from the shadows in a language you do not understand, then leaving the building, walking through a vast city, trees growing through the ruins, the other two monks talking excitingly about this being the answer, what they should do.
  
- Then, via [[Delwath]]’s memory of the shadow darkness, of forgotten memories that he is trying to suppress, a series of memories: first, a commander of a group of soldiers, the eve of battle, telling them they should run, fighting in [[Drankor]] is a fool’s errand, [[Dasa]] is doomed, then in rapid succession nameless memories of fleeing battle, then slowing to focus on a particular memory. An [[Saka|older woman]] talking to a middle-aged man, the older woman saying that this is going to fail, it is too big a risk, and she will not go. The corruption, the pestilence of evil planes that lingered in this land is not so easy to remove, and a failure will be devastating. 
  
- Then, via [[Wellby]]’s memory of being young and his great grandfather pointing out sights as they journeyed to a new place, a memory of a campfire, and a man telling his young child about a trip he took before they were born, far south with the monks of the monastery. Traveling along the [[Hara]] river, past its confluence with the [[Kharja]], crossing through the desert, way south until the land turned green again and a new river cascaded down great cliffs in a massive waterfall, to a green coastal plain full of jungles and savannahs, and an [[Drankor|ancient city]] in ruins, trees growing through it. 
  
- Then, via [[Kenzo]]’s memory of when he left [[Chardon]], filled with a sense of purpose to find the [[Lakan Mystai]] and learn from them, a dark scene, a battlefield in the [[Great War]], armies arrayed against great evil, their purpose clear -- to fight and die so others could live. The terror of the moment is briefly overwhelming, and for a moment the fears of another mind, something else living here in despair -- the mind of [[Sajan]] -- intrudes. The vision of a dark future, where evil wins and [[Dunmar]] is no more. 
  
- Finally, via [[Seeker]]’s memory of a moment when he was a young dwarf, curious about the world, and eavesdropping on a meeting his parents were in, a vision of a young apprentice monk, unable to sleep, walking the stone circle near the fountain, and hearing faint voices. Going to listen, and hearing the deliberations of the masters, to go east. A debate about some portal, some infiltration of evil, that if it could be closed or removed would heal the [[Plaguelands]]. Arguments that it is risky, but decided to proceed anyway, as the mage [[Rai]] will help. 

After that, the party leaves the [[Hall of Stories]] to explore the tower itself. The library and study on the first floor seem to have been emptied entirely by the monks, and the scribing workshop on the second floor is also empty. On the third floor, is a secret library protected by a magical trap, which explodes as the party opens the door. Inside, the room is mostly empty, except for a few spell scrolls left behind in some scroll cubbies.

The party passes quickly through the fourth floor -- a council chamber -- to the fifth floor, which seems to be the private chambers of the master. Here, they find the ghost of [[Karmana]], the last master of the [[Bhishma]] Mystai at this monastery. He is skeptical of them at first, but comes around especially once he realizes that [[Kenzo]] has gone through the initiation rites. 

From [[Karmana]], the party learns that darkness started growing in the land 30 years ago, after the attempt to close the portal failed. He has trouble remembering or even thinking about anything beyond the safety of the tower, and protecting the [[Hall of Stories]], which is his sole purpose now. He does say, however, that maybe nine months ago, or perhaps a year, something changed, a wave of darkness like a shadow ocean washed across the tower, presumably when [[Grash]] arrived. 

As the sun nears the horizon and darkness and night approaches, the party leaves the tower.---

We begin as the party leaves the tower attached to the [[Hall of Stories]] in the evening, as the long shadows begin to stretch across the desert, heading to investigate the Temple of [[Bhishma]] at the [[Monastery of Bhishma|monastery]]. As they approach, [[Delwath]] sees a warning that no one else can sense, but despite the warning the party cautiously enters the temple. 

The entry chapel, dedicated to [[Five Siblings]], has been desecrated and looted, with little left to see or find. Uncertain of the situation, [[Kenzo]] reaches out his senses to detect the presence of good or evil, and notes that something undead is lurking about 20 feet below this room, but nothing ahead or in the side rooms. Continuing on to the main temple, the party finds it more intact, the high windows, now devoid of glass, letting in the evening sun and illuminating a large statue of [[Bhishma]], standing with her hands palm up in supplication. [[Kenzo]] senses more undead in a hallway to the left, and he and [[Delwath]] go to investigate, carefully. Catching only the barest flicker of shadowy movement as a patch of darker shadow detaches itself from the wall, [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] proceed with extreme caution, and eventually illuminate the hallway with [[Kenzo]]’s [[Driftglobe]], revealing three humanoid-looking shadows that retreat from the light. Deciding to retreat in the face of the coming night, the party leaves the temple and the shadows, and heads past the dead [[Orcs|orc]] bodies back to camp.

During the night, [[Delwath]] hears something, a distant clink of armor. As morning dawns, after some conversation about plans, [[Wellby]] sets out to investigate, and quickly discovers that the [[Orcs|orc]] prisoner and the dead bodies of his companions are gone, seemingly come back to life in some form. They have freed their commander and returned to base, upending the party’s developing plans for scouting.

After considering a variety of options, the party decides to turn south, and ride fast, not trying to hide their trail, but then cut west and north on the rockier terrain of the cliffs and canyons west of the now-dry [[Kharja]] river, to try to circle back towards [[Kharsan]]. Pushing hard and into the night, they seem to have lost the trail of the [[Orcs]] in the rocky lands to the west, as the night of May 12th is quiet in the desert.

Heading north, the party circles back to the old Dunmari road that cuts through the Samraat Tombs above the city. After hiding the horses with [[Seeker]]’s magical assistance, the party creeps east, to the old bridge, just under a mile fro the palace, with [[Delwath]] and [[Seeker]] traveling invisibly and [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] sneaking. Despite thinking they may have been spotted during the last desperate dash across 100 yards of open ground, the party gathers in the shelter of the bridge, seemingly safe. Here, [[Delwath]] goes to scout the city, and [[Seeker]] casts clairvoyance targeting the middle of the palace, seeing a [[Grash May 13th|vision of Grash]].

Meanwhile, [[Delwath]] is scouting the city, looking through the ruins of the northern part of [[Kharsan]]. Much has been destroyed here, either long ago, or more recently mined for stone to reconstruct the palace and the [[Orcs|orc]]’s fort to the south. As [[Delwath]] travels through the city, all is quiet save voices in the distance, speaking in Dunmari and calling for help, but seeming to never come nearer even when [[Delwath]] walks towards the sound. In his explorations, he finds some ruins from a glassblower’s shop, some old tools and shattered glasswork, that he brings back with him. 

We end as the party gathers, just before noon, in the shelter of the bridge, with a few minutes of invisibility left, ready to return to the horses and head west, back west out of the desert.---

We begin outside [[Kharsan]], just before noon, as the party is huddled beneath the arches of an old Dunmari bridge over the now-dry [[Kharja]] river, [[Delwath]] having just returned from scouting invisibly in [[Kharsan]]. Pinned down a hundred yards from the shelter of the cliffs on the west side of the riverbank, [[Delwath]] turns himself and [[Seeker]] invisible, while [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] attempt to dash, but the [[Orcs|orcs]] are alerted during the attempt, and horns go up from the [[Orcs|orcs|orc]] fort just south of [[Kharsan]]. With horns blowing and an [[Orcs|orc]] party leaving to investigate, the party forgoes stealth and dashes for their horses, riding hard to put as much ground between them and the following [[Orcs|orcs]] as possible. 

Pushing hard and fast across the desert, and heading directly for [[Havdar]]’s camp to restock their water supplies, the party outdistances the [[Orcs|orcs]]. Taking precautions at night to have light available -- more worried about the shadows [[Grash]] sent than the [[Orcs|orcs]] -- the party makes it a day, a night and another day across the desert without incident. 

The second night in the desert out from [[Kharsan]], the party is ambushed in the night by shadowy figures, humanoid shadows, with a pack of shadowy dogs following them. While the shadows seem to drain the very strength from the body when they hit, they are hindered by daylight, and with the use of the [[Driftglobe|driftglobes]] combined by [[Seeker]]’s magically created magnesium flare, the party is able to dispatch the threat, although not before the shadow dogs manage to kill two of the horses. 

In the morning, the party presses on for [[Havdar]]’s camp, arriving in the evening as the sun is setting. [[Havdar]] has left -- the camp empty and packed up -- but the spring in the canyon provides welcome clean water and a sheltered place to rest. Turning southwest, the party heads for the stone house of [[Avaras]] and [[Pava]]. At [[Pava and Avaras' House]], [[Kenzo]] discusses his initiation into the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]]. Over dinner, the party summarizes the events at the monastery of [[Bhishma]], discussing [[Heart of Shakun]] and [[Bhishma]]’s message. [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]] know little of the temple of [[Shakun]], but agree that if such an artifact were lost it could explain much about the events of the past year. 

The next morning, taking their leave of [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]], the party heads across the desert, passing the ruins of [[Bas Udda]] and returning to [[Karawa]] on May 23rd, nearly a month after leaving with [[Havdar]] to scout the desert.---

We begin as [[Delwath]], [[Wellby]], [[Kenzo]], and [[Seeker]] approach [[Karawa]] from the south road as the sun begins to sink in the sky, after five days of travel across the desert from [[Pava and Avaras' House]] to the east. As they approach [[Karawa]], a patrol of [[Centaurs|centaurs]] and Dunmari intercept them, glad to see the party return safe from the desert. [[Candrosa]] would urgently like to speak with them, and so the party follows into [[Karawa]]. 

The situation in [[Karawa]] is grim. There have been several more attacks, from undead skeletal gnolls, from wild beasts, from ankhegs, and more [[Centaurs|centaurs]] and [[Dunmar|Dunmari]] have died. What’s more, the messenger send to the Samraat court in [[Nayahar]] has finally returned with the news that the ruler of [[Dunmar]], the Samraat [[Nayan Karnas]], will not commit imperial troops to defend [[Karawa]], and will only commit to a defense of the river [[Hara]], near the city of [[Tokra]]. What’s more, [[Seeker]] notes that the mesa around the [[Temple of Shakun]] seems to be crumbling. 

The party speaks with [[Candrosa]], who seems to have aged with worry and exhaustion. He admits he has failed, he has made a grave mistake, and there is much he did not tell the party earlier, out of worry and doubt over the possible consequences of revealing the secrets of his order. He tells [[Seeker]] of the chamber below the mesa where the [[Shakun Mystai|Mystai of Shakun]] grow stone and rock to make their magical powders and ointments, and apologizes to [[Delwath]] for tricking him into seeing a vision that he thought was from [[Shakun]] but was in fact [[Candrosa]]’s manipulation with his [[Dreamweaver Staff|staff]]. But, before he tells the full story of the [[Heart of Shakun]], he tells them that a [[Drikod|stoneborn traveler]] is in town, who has come asking questions about the failure of the protections on the Dunmari border, and he would tell the story once to all of them. [[Delwath]], [[Kenzo]], [[Seeker]], and [[Wellby]] meet [[Drikod]], the [[stoneborn]] from a small village in the mountains to the north. After introductions and some brief conversation, the party hears the story of [[Heart of Shakun]] from [[Candrosa]]. 

[[Candrosa]] tells them of a woman, [[Cintra]], in whom the spirit of [[Shakun]] seems to live embodied in the mortal world, who has something of the power of the divine in her. She is the Supreme Oracle of the [[Shakun Mystai]], a person outside the hierarchy of the order, a prophet acknowledged to have a direct connection to the goddess [[Shakun]]. Several years ago, she had a daughter late in life, [[Jumi]], in whom the blessing of [[Shakun]] seemed to be very strong, for she could make colors run in the desert sand before she could talk. Some months ago, her daughter took ill, and no magic could cure her. [[Cintra]] was convinced that [[Shakun]] was speaking to her in her dreams, and telling her to take her daughter and [[Heart of Shakun]] south of the [[Red Mesa]], to a place called [[Shakun’s Wellspring]], a sacred grove. Here, [[Cintra]]’s dreams said, the power of the Heart could heal her daughter. She left with some trusted companions in early February, and no one has heard from her since, despite several efforts of the mystai to send rescue. [[Candrosa]] also tells them that the absence of [[Heart of Shakun]] from its place in the temple is responsible for the failure of the protections on the borders of [[Dunmar]], but he literally is unable to speak about how it works, and says he has to show them instead. 

After some discussion in which the party is understandably annoyed that [[Candrosa]] was not more forthcoming earlier, he admits his only excuse is that this knowledge has been secret for so long, he was genuinely unsure what would happen if he told outsiders -- the gods work in mysterious ways after all. He now no longer trusts his judgment, however, and is willing to consider something like telling [[Havdar]] and marching a small army south to try to rescue [[Cintra]] and her daughter (if they are alive), or at least recover the Heart. And he does agree to at least tell [[Tharandros]] about the Heart. But he remains nervous that revealing this secret widely will have unexpected consequences, and at [[Delwath]]’s suggestion says he will try to search in dreams to find out whether the secret has already been revealed. The party agrees to return the following evening for a ceremony to understand the nature of [[Shakun]]’s Heart and its magic.

At this the party leaves to set up camp and tend to business, including showing the broken glassware from [[Kharsan]] to the mirror, seeing [[Kharsan Broken Glassware Vision|a vision of its history]]. 

During their day in town, [[Delwath]] speaks with [[Tharandros]] and confirms that [[Candrosa]] told him of the Heart, and [[Wellby]] negotiates barding for [[Baxter]] in exchange for a nicely made map of the area they’ve traveled in, although it will take three days to be ready. 

After that, the party returns to the temple in the evening, where [[Candrosa]] tells them that the only way to show them the magic of the [[Heart of Shakun]] is to go through the initiation ceremony into the Mystai, although without the Heart this is not the full initiation and they will not be [[Shakun Mystai]] or bound to the order afterward. He also tells them that part of the magic ties the people together via their shared experiences and memories of [[Dunmar]], but since none of the party grew up here he is not sure what will happen. 

He leads the party through the temple to a chamber underneath the mesa, lit by torches that burn with blue fire. A pool of water sits in the middle of the cavern, which bursts into blue flame as a mystai plunges a torch into it. The party are given sips of some thick potion, and then pushed underwater, where they find that breathing is no issue and the fire does not burn as their eyes close. 

They experience [[The Shakun Mystai Initiation]]

As the initiation ritual ends, the party snaps awake to shouts in the darkness, screams, as through a veil of blue flames shadowy forms are detaching from the wall to attack. The shadows from [[Kharsan]] have tracked the party, and taken this moment of vulnerability to launch and attack. Despite the difficulties of being caught without gear, the party fights off the shadows, although not before two mystai are killed, drained of energy and turned to withered husks by the shadow creatures. 

We end as the party regroups, helping [[Candrosa]] tend to the bodies of the dead and preparing for a funeral and plans in the morning. ---

We begin in the evening, as the sun has set and the [[Candrosa]] is leading the funeral service for those who died in the shadow attack at the end of the ritual of [[Shakun]]. As [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], [[Delwath]], [[Drikod]], and [[Kenzo]] watch the funeral pyres burn and listen to the prayers of [[Candrosa]], the lingering visions of the ritual leave the impression of webs of power connecting the initiates of [[Shakun]] together in a network of power. But the center is missing, and power seems to be slowly ebbing away. Hinting at the consequences of revealing the secret widely, the party can also faintly see six gray, brittle lines of the web, where they and [[Tharandros]] connect to the web of power, but don’t contribute as they are not truly initiated. The party spends the evening discussing their plans, and also briefly discussing [[Wellby]]’s memories or vision of a woods in deep twilight, following a stream to a glade that is dark and old, as he held the bow [[Delwath]] summoned for him during the shadow fight. 

The next morning, before heading south across the [[Red Mesa]] to find [[Shakun’s Wellspring]] and perhaps [[Cintra]], or some clue of her, the party speaks with [[Candrosa]] once more. He describes [[Shakun’s Wellspring]] -- a great open bowl canyon, below sheer cliffs stretching five hundred feet, accessible only by a narrow slot canyon that can be entered from a stair marked by a circle of stone trees grown from the rock of the mesa itself. [[Candrosa]] says it is a place of healing, and it does make sense that [[Cintra]] might go there to try to heal her sick young daughter. The mesa, [[Candrosa]] believes, is somehow [[Shakun]] herself, or contains her essence somehow. But the Supreme Oracle -- [[Cintra]] -- was always the guardian of [[Heart of Shakun]]. Before the party leaves, [[Candrosa]] gives them a scroll of sending, and asks to be alerted to news when they have anything to tell him.

Then, after gathering what supplies they can in [[Karawa]], the party leaves south across the [[Red Mesa]]. The first day of travel is fairly uneventful, although the mesa is very quiet, and as the party travels south, they have the feeling that something is easing their passage, clearing the rough terrain ahead and keeping crevasses from opening under their feet. On the second day, [[Drikod]] sends his silver raven ahead to scout, who returns twelve hours later with a report that, up ahead, a band of gnolls, skeletons, and other undead guard the entrance to [[Shakun’s Wellspring]].

The party decides to creep forward to within a mile of the entrance and get a better look with [[Seeker]]’s magic. They are able, then, to count about 20 creatures, a mix of skeletal gnolls, fleshy undead creatures of some kind, and gnoll hunters with longbows. They seem to be guarding the entrance but primarily to keep people from leaving. 

After a lot of debate, the party finally decides to circle around the guards and attempt to descend into the wellspring by flying down the sheer cliff walls, after [[Drikod]] reads the omens of the future and reports that this is a good course of action. When the party reaches the cliffs above [[Shakun’s Wellspring]], they see that at the bottom, five hundred feet below the cliff edge, there is a small camp set up near the circle of trees marking the Wellspring itself. A woman, [[Cintra]], kneels in prayer near the camp, and some distance away are a number of grave markers and the remains of a funeral pyre. The party begins to descend, which starts uneventfully, with [[Drikod]] (carrying [[Wellby]]) scaling down the wall using his spider climb spell, and [[Kenzo]] and then [[Seeker]] flying down with [[Delwath]]’s magic. When [[Kenzo]] speaks to [[Cintra]], almost the first thing she says is that he needs to hide, immediately, or risk everything. 

As confusion breaks out across the party, [[Kenzo]] rushes to hide among the trees while [[Seeker]] descends, [[Delwath]] hides at the top of the cliff, and [[Drikod]] begins to climb back up the cliffs. Eventually, [[Seeker]] and [[Kenzo]] end up crouched in [[Cintra]]’s tent, as from the far side of the canyon a [[Samerki|creature]] emerges: maybe seven feet tall, or a bit under, generally human in features but somehow unnaturally stretched or elongated, giving him an eerie, not-quite-human feel. This creature carried a huge, spiked club, and wore a dark cloak putting his face in shadow. He looked down at [[Cintra]], laughing, and saying in a booming and cruel voice, “Good, you are still here, your daughter will live another day.” As he looks around, he seems to notice something on the far side of the cliffs, and heads towards [[Wellby]] and [[Drikod]]. While [[Drikod]] casts meld with stone and fades into the cliff wall, [[Wellby]] is caught in the open, defiant and knocking an arrow without a good place to hide. As the creature flies across the canyon towards [[Wellby]], [[Delwath]] turns his shadow into a vaguely humanoid form, and sends it running across the top of the canyon, distracting the creature searching for [[Wellby]] for a moment. As it goes to swing its club towards the [[Wellby]] shadow, [[Cintra]] yells in a supernaturally loud voice from below, as she causes an illusion to appear before her of a shadowy halfling form, “Wait, that is me. That was just my trick. I will give you want you want, just come back in the morning. Please. I can’t stay here any longer.” 

The creature, distracted by this moment, lands and looks down at [[Cintra]], laughing again, saying “I must report.” It takes a small stone out of its pocket, concentrating for a moment, and says, “She’s still here. Don’t kill her daughter. She’s agreed she’ll tell us what we need in the morning. I’m not sure it’s worth your travel.” And then it flies off. 

The session ends with [[Kenzo]] and [[Seeker]] hiding in [[Cintra]]’s tent, [[Drikod]] melded with the stone of the cliff, [[Delwath]] hiding while his shadow (looking vaguely like [[Wellby]]) moves along the edge of the cliff, and [[Wellby]] crouching in the open on the clifftop, hiding the best he can, bow at the ready.

The session begins with the party still scattered across various hiding places, as the vaguely human creature known as [[Samerki]] seemingly disappears. However, [[Cintra]] warns the party to stay put, as this creature has, in the past, disappeared for some time to lull interlopers into complacency and then descended again with a blast of cold to freeze and kill them. Sure enough, after some time passes the creature returns, invisible, chasing [[Delwath]]’s shadow and seemingly not noticing anyone else. After a blast of cold air damages but does not kill the shadow, [[Samerki]] grapples it, and flies above the canyon floor to drop it to its death, and then continues to circle, invisible but audible to [[Wellby]]’s sharp ears. As he circles, he taunts [[Cintra]], and makes it clear that he is a servant of [[Agata]] Dustmother.

While [[Drikod]] remains hidden in stone, and [[Wellby]] and [[Delwath]] plot a way to get across the 15 feet of bare rock to the canyon edge, [[Kenzo]] and [[Seeker]] watch as [[Shakun’s Wellspring]] fills with water, and [[Cintra]] retrieves the Heart of [[Shakun]] from its resting place within. Using the Heart, she begins to spin a web of illusion that expands to fill the canyon, creating an impenetrable mess of jumbled rocks and tangled rubble. [[Kenzo]], drawn in by [[Heart of Shakun]], lets it reach out and connect with him, and the added energy of his will contributing to [[Cintra]]’s allows the illusion to expand to encompass [[Wellby]] and [[Delwath]] hiding at the canyon’s edge. 

As [[Drikod]] descends and [[Wellby]] and [[Delwath]] fly down in turn, the party settles into camp to hear [[Cintra]]’s story. As she tells it, she did indeed come to the Wellspring because her daughter was ill, and she had dreams that she thought were from [[Shakun]] telling her to come here. However, when she arrived, she found [[Agata]] and [[Samerki]] waiting, and [[Agata]] charmed her. While she did not reveal the existence of the Heart, she couldn’t help but tell [[Agata]] that her daughter was strong in [[Shakun]]’s power. Believing [[Jumi]] to be the key, [[Agata]] took her, warning [[Cintra]] as the charm faded not to leave the Wellspring or her daughter would die. This was in February, and [[Samerki]] watched ever since, killing one group that came to attempt a rescue. 

While [[Cintra]] was not sure of [[Agata]]’s ultimate goals, she believed that [[Agata]] thought [[Jumi]] was the key to power over the Dunmari border, although exactly why [[Agata]] wanted such thing no one really knew, beyond speculation that she had made a bargain with someone or something. [[Cintra]] also believed that [[Agata]] was searching for something, a cloak or [[Cloak of Rainbows]] from divine influence, that would silence the gods and allow [[Agata]] to extract what power she could from [[Jumi]], perhaps even turning her into a foul fey creature. At this, [[Seeker]] recalled that he had read of this cloak in a mostly-destroyed book on the ancient artifacts of the last ruler of [[Drankor]], [[Apollyon]], who sought to become as a god himself. The cloak, it is said, could create dead zones where gods could not reach and divine magic had no power.

With the story told, the discussion turned to how to get the Heart back to [[Karawa]] without endangering [[Cintra]]’s daughter, focusing on either luring [[Agata]] to the Wellspring with [[Jumi]], or luring [[Agata]] away from her lair and sneaking in to rescue [[Jumi]]. After a long debate, ultimately the party decided to wait and ask [[Shakun]] whether [[Agata]] was coming with [[Jumi]], and adjust tactics based on [[Shakun]]’s answer.

The next day around midday, the answer came: [[Agata]] was traveling with [[Jumi]]. So the party set their trap. Everyone would wait in the Wellspring until a signal, hopefully [[Jumi]] entering the Wellspring, and then would emerge and attack. Amazingly, the plan worked. As [[Jumi]] -- or, apparently [[Jumi]], for she looked like a toddler sized wooden puppet with a human, fleshy face -- entered and said “now”, the party emerged to fight [[Agata]] and [[Samerki]]. 

The battle was tough, as [[Agata]] opened with a swarm of biting locusts emerging from her robes, and soon after healed herself with a swarm of fey wasps. [[Samerki]], the oni, managed to catch [[Kenzo]], [[Cintra]], and [[Seeker]] in his blast of cold, knocking [[Kenzo]] and [[Seeker]] unconscious momentarily. But a key stun from [[Kenzo]], consistent damage from [[Wellby]] and [[Delwath]], and finally the killing blow from [[Wellby]]’s bow at point blank range turned the tide for the party.---

Our session begins at dusk, as the party silent, tired, stands before the dead bodies of [[Agata]] Dustmother and her oni servant, [[Samerki]]. As [[Cintra]] rushes to comfort her daughter, [[Jumi]], in relief and also terror at what [[Agata]] has turned her into, the party takes stock.

While [[Wellby]] goes to scout into the slot canyon that leads to the exit from the Wellspring and [[Delwath]] begins his ritual to activate Elmerica’s Sight, [[Seeker]] removes a [[Pearl of Power|small pearl]] from his back, concentrates for a moment, and then goes to [[Jumi]] and attempts to unweave the magic that has turned her mostly into a wooden puppet. While a challenging task, he succeeds in doing so, and the party sees the wood melting away from her. [[Cintra]], overwhelmed with gratitude, throws her arms around [[Seeker]] as [[Jumi]] tries to climb into his lap.

Meanwhile, [[Delwath]] begins a slow, careful investigation of what is on [[Agata]] and [[Samerki]]’s bodies. There is a lot to sort through, and it takes some time to [[Party Treasure|catalog]].

As [[Cintra]] emerges from her tent, having just gotten [[Jumi]] to sleep, [[Wellby]] hears a noise from the slot canyon, of something falling into the pit trap. With only a few moments for some healing magic, the party prepares for combat. With the fire [[Elementals|elemental]], still around from the battle with [[Agata]], blocking the exit from the slot canyon, [[Kenzo]] throwing the gnoll archers arrows back at them, a well-targeted use of [[Delwath]]’s magical green flame blade, [[Seeker]] animating a boulder to attack, [[Shakun]]’s aid in the form of [[Cintra]]’s bless spell, and some carefully aimed arrows from [[Wellby]], the party manages to hold off the gnoll excursion. Particularly effective is a combination of [[Seeker]] turning the canyon floor to quicksand, holding a number of the creatures in place for [[Drikod]]’s flaming sphere to burn over and over again.

As the combat ends and the party recovers, and realizes that [[Jumi]] slept through the whole thing across the canyon in [[Cintra]]’s tent, the fire elemental burns the bodies as their last act before returning to their native [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], but not before confirming by the last gnoll’s reaction to [[Agata]]’s dead body that they did in fact work for [[Agata]]. 

The party and [[Cintra]] talk into the night about the nature of the [[Shakun’s Wellspring]], [[Agata]]’s magic, and more. [[Cintra]] shares what she knows of the Wellspring -- it is an ever-changing land of hard to navigate terrain, a place where those who try to defeat [[Shakun]]’s protections along the eastern border of [[Dunmar]] find themselves wandering, until they die of hunger or thirst. 

While the party quickly agrees that investigating [[Agata]]’s lair would be a worthy goal and an important next step, the first priority is getting [[Cintra]], [[Jumi]], and [[Heart of Shakun]] back to [[Karawa]]. The journey back is a little slow, as the horses have vanished, led back to [[Karawa]] by [[Baxter]] after the party failed to return to camp in time, and [[Jumi]] can only walk so fast. But after two days of travel, the party arrives in [[Karawa]]. 

In [[Karawa]], [[Cintra]] and [[Jumi]] vanish to deal with [[Heart of Shakun]], while the party is approached by [[Candrosa]]. [[Candrosa]] is overjoyed, profusing thanking the party and telling them they have saved him from his greatest mistake. He also shares the news that a group of Chardonians passed through a few days before, coming out of the desert and heading west. He promises to return later with whatever stories about [[Agata]] and especially her lair he can glean from the folks currently in town.

After talking to [[Candrosa]], the party speaks with [[Havdar]], about the Chardonians. At [[Havdar]]’s camp is also [[Baxter]], newly equipped with his axebeak armor. Finally, they turn to speak with [[Tharandros]], who is pleased with the parties actions, not so much for what they did for [[Karawa]] and [[Dunmar]], but their work in removing now two great evils from the land (the demon in [[Raven's Hold]] and [[Agata]] Dustmother). [[Tharandros]] tells them his people must continue their delayed migration north, but to leave a message with any passing [[Centaurs|centaur]] if they learn more of the evils, curses, and disease still lying on the [[Plaguelands]]. He is not particularly concerned with the doings of gods, but is and remains very concerned about the sickness that seems to still linger there. As they part, [[Tharandros]] tells them that the future is clouded and many paths from this point are possible, but that he feels strangely optimistic. 

Finally, the party returns to camp. Before discussing their next steps, they show the [[Scepter of Command]] to [[The Mirror of the Past]], receiving [[Scepter of Command Vision|a vision of its creation and past]]. 

After discussion of what they just saw, and everything that has happened, the party ultimately decides that at this point they need knowledge and lore, and the obvious place to look is [[Tokra]], where [[Kenzo]] has connections to the [[Lakan Mystai]], and which is also one of the oldest cities in [[Dunmar]] and home to a significant library. With that, the party sets camp and prepares for sleep.---

## Narrative
The party decided to explore a little more before entering the ruined fort, and discovered a campsite in the foundations of the outbuildings outside the fort. The camp itself was several days to several weeks old, and had clearly been disturbed by animals (signs of scattered food -- salt pork and dried fish and the like that had been partially eaten by animals). Whoever made the camp had left most of their stuff, except weapons and water, and went somewhere. 

After investigating the camp, the party decided to follow the tracks up the causeway into the fort. Inside, only three buildings still had walls: a central headquarters building, a five-sided temple (which retained a metal roof), and two towers guarding the entryway. In addition, there was an empty cistern, cracked at the bottom. 

Sounds of a large clacking / chittering creature from the central building drew them in. [[Wellby]] began sneaking quietly towards the walls to investigate, as the sounds when quiet momentarily. [[Delwath]] suddenly remembered tales of a large desert monstrosity that hunted by tunneling underground and ambushing prey, but before he could say anything, a giant insect, a cross between a centipede and a preying mantis, burst from underground and grabbed [[Wellby]] in its mandibles. Despite a few tense moments as [[Wellby]] was in danger of being eaten, [[Kenzo]]’s quick action to whack the creature across the mandibles freed [[Wellby]], and the ankheg was dispatched by [[Delwath]]’s longsword blow after being knocked prone by [[Seeker]] excavating the loose earth under its back legs. 

Searching after the battle, the party found a pit in the ground going down into a cave complex, but first decided they needed to rest and recover. Exploring the intact building, they discovered it was a temple to [[Five Siblings]]: [[Jeevali]], the goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family; [[Laka]], the god of knowledge, agriculture and the seasons, and time; [[Aagir]], the god of war, fire, and death; [[Sonkar]], the goddess of beauty, truth, artisans, and justice; and [[Chidya]], the goddess of nature, the land, animals, and weather. In this temple, the altar to [[Aagir]] seemed the most important, and a small [[Aagir's Everlight|silver spearpoint statue]], engraved with a flame motif and burning with a fire that seemed to have no source of fuel, still stood on the altar. This item radiated evocation magic, and magic was also threaded through the walls of the temple, perhaps giving them more stability and structure. While resting and recovering, a search of the wreckage inside the temple also turned up some heavier religious items (bronze chalices, silver candlesticks, some amulets and small statues). 

After the rest, the party decided to first explore the towers, and then head down into the tunnel. While one tower was full of rubble, the other was more intact, and the party found the remains of a Dunmari solider, possibly a scout, from several hundred years ago. While most of the scout’s items were rotted away, a [[Horn of Silent Alarm|magical horn]] with an etched running horse design was still in good order. 

Taking the horn and the continual flame spearpoint, the party descended down into the tunnel. It was a low, narrow crawl, until a small cavern containing two exits, and a very lifelike statue of a [[Arcus|human man]], wearing a cloak and leather armor, with a dagger in one hand and a torch in an arm that was broken and lying on the ground. Also on the ground was a [[Floating Disc Coin|golden coin]], looking like a Chardonian coin from several hundred years ago, that was unusually heavy and radiated transformation magic. [[Seeker]] flipped the coin, and it turned into a floating disk that hovered 3 feet off the ground, and seemed to follow [[Seeker]].

Continuing to explore, the party found what seemed to be a cockatrice nursery, where they found a lion that was continually turning into stone and then back into flesh, while several cockatrice babies pecked at it, or each other, or some large mottled eggs nestled against a muddy pit. Sneaking back unnoticed, they decided to explore the other passageway. After leading under the cracked cistern, the passage opened into a larger cavern, where three skeletons attacked, soon followed by an undead [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]], carried a [[Black Iron Staff]] with a smooth obsidian stone mounted to the top. After defeating the undead, the party realized the obsidian staff must be the source of the abnormal beasts, and managed to destroy it, using both the enchanted spearpoint and a shadowy blade [[Delwath]] summoned into his hand, aided by [[Seeker]]’s insight into a hidden flaw and weak point in the crystal. While the obsidian seemed to resist non-magical damage, a few blows were enough for it to shatter, and calm to prevail, although at the cost of some damaging psychic backlash.

As peace and calm permeated the area after the destruction of the obsidian, the party spent a quiet, restful night in the temple.

Our session begins at dawn, as the party leaves [[Karawa]] in search of [[Agata's lair]]. Armed with rumors from [[Candrosa]] that the lair was only approachable from the north, but marked by a path lined with dead trees, the party headed south towards [[Bas Udda]]. Here, they spent the night and cached some supplies, before turning south the next morning.

Scouting by [[Drikod]] and [[Wellby]] identified the line of trees. [[Delwath]] sent his shadow to investigate, which did not return, but [[Wellby]] caught the sounds of battle on the wind. Deciding that there must be a better way to approach, and pooling their resources, the party managed to fly across the line of trees, using a boulder animated by [[Seeker]]’s magic, plus [[Delwath]]’s fly spell, and [[Drikod]]’s ability to turn into a small animal to ride along. But not before attempting to use [[Agata]]’s [[Obsidian Fly]], which turned out to attack them, and apparently was enchanted somehow by [[Agata]] to attack anyone besides her that summoned it. After a brief melee, during which the fly is whacked by [[Kenzo]] and grappled by [[Seeker]]’s earthen hand, [[Seeker]] succeeds in using the fly’s command word to turn it back into an obsidian sculpture.

Arriving at [[Agata]]’s hut, the party saw a field with a wooden scarecrow, the house itself, and a low hill covered on top with dense, dark scrub. The scarecrow told them to leave, that [[Agata]] was not in but would be back soon and they could speak to her then. [[Wellby]], noticing its eyes were real, not made of wood, points this out and the party realizes this may be one of the trapped puppets of [[Agata]]. After some conversation [[Seeker]] managed to dispel the enchantment, and the scarecrow shifted into the form of [[Garret Tealeaf]], an older halfling man. He is amazed and stunned.

The party then approaches the house. One by one, [[Wellby]], [[Delwath]], and then [[Drikod]] vanish into thin air as they approach the open door. [[Kenzo]] and [[Seeker]] are left to puzzle what is going on. Eventually, they figure that it has something to do with sight, and so [[Kenzo]] enters the house blindfolded. After bumbling around a bit, he knocks over a mirror, which luckily falls with its reflective side down. [[Seeker]] uses his [[Goggles of Object Reading]] to study the mirror, learning it is a [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], and the prisoners in it can be freed by speaking a command word and then the number of a cell. 

After [[Delwath]], [[Drikod]], and [[Wellby]] are freed from the mirror, the party continues to investigate [[Agata's lair]], finding a large number of magic items and treasure. In the storeroom are several sacks of flour filled with coins and silver, and in the bedroom is a fleshy humanoid creature with vacant eyes from which a faint buzzing can be heard.

The party decides to retreat for the evening with the loot before returning to destroy the house in the morning with more resources. Taking all the magic and valuable treasure they could find, as well as the nice wooden table and chair in the kitchen they suspect are actually the last two trapped people, they fly back using [[Seeker]]’s animated boulder and [[Delwath]]’s magic. 

As the session ends, the party is setting up camp in a small canyon about 1 ½ miles north of [[Agata]]’s lair. [[Seeker]] attempts to break the enchantment on both the chair and the table, succeeding only on one, the table, which turns into an [[Shandar|old Dunmari man]], catatonic and rocking back and forth in confusion and fear.---

Our session begins at dusk, as the party establishes camp in a small canyon about 1 ½ miles north of [[Agata's lair]]. After an evening discussing the freed prisoners, the mirror, and what to do with [[Agata]]’s loot and lair, the party drifts off to rest, with [[Wellby]] on watch. [[Garret Tealeaf]], the elderly halfling, wanders over to talk for a bit, reiterating his fear of the magic from [[Agata]]’s house, and starting to open up about his experiences as [[Agata]]’s servant, especially the terrible screams he would hear from the hut at times, when a band of [[Orcs]] attacks by surprise.

The [[Orcs]], joined by a wereraven and some jackalweres, initially seem intent on stealing the treasure, going for high value, easy to carry items. When the party fights back, hard, they begin to retreat, and are largely foiled. Two, however, do flee: a single jackalwere, and one of the stealthy [[Orcs|orc]] shadows, the [[Orcs|orc]] shadow stealing and later killing a horse. 

With the threat driven off, the party goes back to sleep, waking some hours past sunrise. In the morning, the party searches for tracks, and realizes that the [[Orcs]] came from [[Agata's lair]], perhaps from the mysterious shadowy hill that was never investigated. The idea that [[Orcs]], perhaps lots of [[Orcs]], may be waiting for them makes the idea of returning to the lair less appealing. The party decides to return to [[Bas Udda]], take some time to hide the heavy loot, and then return to [[Karawa]] to decide what to do.

While food is short, the journey is not difficult, interrupted only by a moment of doubt when [[Kenzo]] and [[Drikod]] sense, with the crossing of [[Shakun]]’s protection, that some of what they bring is evil, and feel a moment of questioning, whether they are sure they know what they are doing will not bring harm to [[Dunmar]]. At this, the party debates whether to destroy some items, and starts by burning the [[Thorn Seed Bag]] that wither the ground they are planted in.

The party arrives at the outskirts of [[Karawa]] a few days later, not wanting to bring whatever may be trapped in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] into [[Karawa]]. After fetching [[The Mirror of the Past]] and telling [[Cintra]] about the trip to [[Agata's lair]], the party shows the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] to [[The Mirror of the Past]], seeing [[Mirror of Soul Trapping Vision|a vision of its history]]. 

As the scene fades, while [[Seeker]] and [[Drikod]] puzzle over the architecture of the castle in the last scene, eventually placing it as pre-[[Great War]] hobgoblin architecture from the eastern side of the mountains, [[Cintra]] stands by, shocked. She tells the party that the first Dunmari woman they saw is Nayan [[Sura]], the woman who should be Samraat of [[Dunmar]]. [[Sura]] was supposed to be the heir to the throne, but she vanished 8 years ago, leading her brother to take the throne in her place. 

The party quickly frees her quickly after that. She does not know [[Agata]], remembering only a giant spiked club (perhaps [[Samerki]]’s weapon, which you recall was also a giant spiked club) and then a faint memory of being half-awake in a smoky room, staring at her bloody head in a mirror before she vanished into a strange blank foggy mist. 

During the brief conversation that follows, the party recalls some of the political rumors they have heard, that [[Sura]] was seen as a unifying force, someone who could unite the eastern and western factions into Greater [[Dunmar]]. When she vanished, her brother [[Nayan Karnas]] turned to the west and abandoned the eastern Dunmari, recently refusing to sent troops to help with the gnolls, for example. [[Sura]] insists that the other two Dunmari ([[Isha]] and [[Selkan]]) are freed, and after seeing the tortures they have suffered gives the party a writ of travel (not so useful at the moment) and thanks them for their work. 

The session ends as [[Sura]] tells them to keep her reappearance quiet until the [[Feast of Bhishma]], [[Cintra]] takes the broken Dunmari mystai freed from the mirror back to the temple, and the party turns to [[Karawa]], to take care of loose ends and other business until the [[Feast of Bhishma]] in 9 days time. ---

The party spends a little more than a week in [[Karawa]], taking care of various activities around town. [[Kenzo]] and [[Drikod]] spend the time preparing for the ritual of initiation into the [[Shakun Mystai]], culminating in the [initiation ritual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18pWViOdRUlZYB022HiltIWsfXaoxcB7bN1cUSGpOrbY/edit) on the evening before the [[Feast of Bhishma]]. [[Wellby]] spends the time working on his map, training with [[Baxter]], and traveling to [[Bas Udda]] with [[Havdar]] and members of his band, to recover the treasure the party left there. [[Seeker]] spent his time studying the artifacts recovered from [[Agata]], especially the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], as well as visiting the mesa with [[Candrosa]] for a tour of the living gardens of stone. [[Delwath]] spent his time closing his affairs in [[Karawa]] and gathering rumors, as well as spending a day and a night in the desert learning more about his patron and source of power. 

During the week of downtime, [[Seeker]] and [[Delwath]] discover more about the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], including new command words. Using these and a lucky guess as to the hobgoblin’s name, the party also interrogates [[Revaka]], the hobgoblin leader they once saw in the mirror. She is distanful and haughty, and initially refuses to speak with [[Delwath]] (“the [[Elves]]”), but eventually the party learns from her a few key pieces of information. She was trapped in the mirror hundreds of years ago, in the 2nd year of the reign of [[Derik III]] of [[Sembara|Sembara]] (DR 1521), by [[Cha'mutte]]. The hobgoblin tribes on the fringes of [[Sembara|Sembara]] were being recruited into [[Cha'mutte]]’s armies, but [[Revaka]] did not want the risk and war of world domination, preferring to maintain her small empire on the fringes of the human world. The mirror itself was made by her grandfather, a wizard in service to the [[Avatus]], now a footnote in history as the foil for the rise of the [[House of Sewick]] of [[Sembara|Sembara]]. 

During this week, the party also looked at the [[Soul Lantern]] in [[The Mirror of the Past]], specifically focusing on [[Soul Lantern Vision|visions of the people that the mirror harmed]].

The first morning of the [[Feast of Bhishma]], the party gathered for breakfast all together for the first time in several days, against the backdrop of the morning prayers of remembrance that mark the beginning of the feast days. [[Delwath]] had just returned from and day and a night in the desert, where he learned that his patron, [[Yezali|Aaviskar]], is a small god of an unknown northern tribe, also trapped in the shadow realm at the end of the [[Great War]], who had in desperation thrown a connection to [[Delwath]] as [[Delwath]] fell from the shadow realm almost a year ago. 

Several others then shared their [[Dreamworld]] experience, guided by [[Candrosa]]'s [[Dreamweaver Staff]]. [[Kenzo]] spoke of his vision of [[Drankor]], where he spoke with [[Rai]] out of time, and saw a vision of the struggle at the heart of [[Drankor]], between the desire for power and greed and the supremacy of humans, and the inclusive vision of a beacon of hope against the darkness. The [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand|fragments of the hand of Rai]], which [[Kenzo]] saw shatter into five pieces in his vision, are connected to some kind of shield protecting [[Drankor]], and perhaps its descendants like [[Chardon]], the darker side of human nature. 

[[Seeker]] also shared his dream vision, of a strange place that seemed to be a map or picture of the planes, like the inside of a sphere of stars with many moving crystal realms floating across it, and elemental planes of earth, air, fire, and water. Through a arch of fire, [[Seeker]] reported a vision of the fiery plane, a city of brass surrounded by pillars of flame on a burning plain with mercury rain. 

The morning prayers of remembrance associated with the [[Feast of Bhishma]] then drew the party’s attention, as [[Cintra]] emerged at this moment to aid in the destruction of the [[Soul Lantern]]. Over the course of the day, the party moved from table to table, speaking with [[Alesh]] and [[Ikram]] and others from the early days of [[Karawa]]. [[Alesh]], always talkative, spoke more of the situation in [[Tokra]]: crowded, and not just with Dunmari; rumors of something stolen from the [[Archives]]; and Chardonian mages camped with the armies of the Samraat [[Nayan Karnas]]. 

The next morning, the party spoke with Nayan [[Sura]]. She asked them to pledge themselves to her service, and while no one was willing to commit that level of engagement, they agreed to be allies. A few hours later, [[Sura]] spoke to the assembled Dunmari of [[Karawa]], announcing herself and asking if those her would be with her, gods willing. With significant support, she and [[Havdar]] planned to ride across the plains to gauge support and gather an army before arriving in [[Tokra]] to speak with the [[Lakan Mystai]] and ask the gods what to do next, what was the way forward for [[Dunmar]]. 

Before leaving [[Karawa]], the party also spoke with two other people. One, a Dunmari citizen of [[Karawa]], had found the [[The Runes of Creation]], the book of runes that [[Seeker]] carries in the desert, and after some cajoling and promises not to reveal his secrets, learned that this man often scavenged for sellable loot in the desert. He had found three books some time ago, two filled with strange writing and one blank, and had sold the ones with writing to [[Servius]], a Chardonian who worked for some library in [[Chardon]]. He found them on an [[Orcs|orc]], an ancient individual, with wrinkled skin, dried out almost like leather, who carried nothing but a ripped pouch and these three books. 

[[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and [[Kenzo]] also spent some time speaking telepathically (via [[Wellby]]) with [[Selkan]], the [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Mystai of Bhishma]] freed from the mirror. He went to [[Agata]] to trade information for information, hoping to learn more about the other planes, but once he realized what [[Agata]] really was, he swore to speak no more to her, or anyone, and cut off his own tongue to prevent her from charming him into revealing the secrets of his order. He told [[Wellby]] that [[Saka]], the old mystai near [[Tokra]], could tell more. She was from an old horse-herding family that traveled across the northern plains, and is likely with them still. 

The morning after the [[Feast of Bhishma]], the party leaves [[Karawa]]: [[Drikod]], heading north and back to his village, and the rest of the party heading west, towards [[Tokra]]. ---

The session starts as the party leaves [[Karawa]], heading west for [[Tokra]], traveling with [[Garret Tealeaf]], a horse-drawn cart laden with food and water and a false bottom hiding their magical mirrors, plus their horses and gear. The first day passes uneventfully along the open terrain, heading to connect with the ancient Drankorian trade road that runs east and west across northern [[Dunmar]]. There is light traffic passing through the desert, everybody eager to return to their normal lives. By the evening of the second day of travel, [[The Mirror of the Past]] had recharged enough to be used, and the party used it to look at the [[Floating Disc Coin]] found near the petrified form of [[Arcus]] in the fort east of [[Gomat]], seeing a [[Floating Disc Coin Vision|vision of its history]].

As he watches this scene unfold, [[Garret Tealeaf]] is suspicious, afraid of the magic you have taken from the lairs of powerful creatures, worried that perhaps the owner of this mirror is watching you, somehow. 

The third day of travel is interrupted when [[Seeker]] hears a voice in his mind. It turns out to be a [[Fey|fey]] creature, [[Typhina]], who is currently trapped in the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]] [[Seeker]] obtained from [[Agata]]. She tells [[Ring of the Warded Mind#Typhina's Story|her story to Seeker telepathically]].

On the fifth day of travel, the party passes a ruined aqueduct in the distance, and cannot resist the temptation to investigate. A Dunmari family of goat herders is camped here, and looks at the party strangely as they begin to climb over the aqueduct, exploring it. Eventually, they discover that a faint enchantment from Drankorian days still remains on this stonework, amplifying water that passes through the channel. [[Seeker]] constructs an earthen berm for easy access, so the Dunmari can use this as a small oasis in the desert, and the party spends the evening here, enjoying the food and company of the Dunmari herders. 

On the ninth day of travel, a few days out from [[Tokra]], the mirror has recharged again. After some discussion, the party decides to carefully, using mage hand, show the four dried scorpions from [[Agata]]’s belt pouch to the mirror. As they do, they can see, [[Dried Scorpion Vision|reflected in the mirror]], a giant scorpion, wiggling and struggling against some force that is holding it still, struggling to free itself. As [[Wellby]] spots the dried scorpion begin to wiggle in response, he takes careful aim and pierces the scorpion with an arrow that obliterates it. Realizing these are trapped items that grow into giant scorpions when handled or subjected to strong magic, the party destroys the other three quickly and thoroughly. 

On the eleventh day after leaving [[Karawa]], the party arrives at the outskirts of [[Tokra]]. After riding across the great bridge over the [[Hara]] river, and paying the toll to the Dunmari guards, the party decides their first stop will be the [[Lakan Monastery]]. [[Kenzo]] has sent word ahead he is returning, and is expected. The session ends as [[Wellby]] escorts Garrett across town to [[The Red Lily Inn]], a halfling inn near the western gate run by [[Wes Strongbones]] and his teenage boys [[Tye Strongbones]] and [[Cade Strongbones]], and the remainder of the party arrives at the monastery and is greeted by [[Kenzo]]’s old master, [[Rishi]].---

The session starts as the party (excepting [[Wellby]], who is taking [[Garret Tealeaf]] to [[The Red Lily Inn]]) stands in the entrance to the [[Lakan Monastery]], in front of the Lakan monk [[Rishi]], [[Kenzo]]’s friend and master. After introductions, the party learns from [[Rishi]] that the [[Lakan Mystai]] have had omens and dreams, and many of the monks, including Speaker [[Lara]], are currently traveling to hopefully learn more of these omens. For the past three weeks, many of the mystai have had premonitions that the cycle of history was out of sync with itself, that the branching paths of the past, once pruned and gone into history, are now renewed. Speaker [[Lara]] had a dream of a watchtower to the east, one of the many guard towers built before the [[Great War]] to protect the northern reaches of [[Dunmar]], and left with many companions to visit this place a few days ago. 

While the party gets settled into the monastery, unloading the cart and finding secure places to store extra stuff, [[Wellby]] arrives, and the party decides to stay at the monastery for dinner. During dinner, they meet [[Basu]], the eccentric artisan who runs the workshop of the Lakan monks and is an expert in crafting magic items with extradimensional spaces. He is grumpy and upset, because no one will pay attention to his problems, everyone being too concerned with the strange omens. He explains that, beneath this monastery, there is an old elven ruin with a weak point between the planes. He uses the energy that spills out in the construction of magic items, but if it is not harvested it is likely to accumulate in strange ways. No one has bothered to go down in weeks, given the distraction of the omens. They also are introduced to [[Kassi]], the head librarian, and [[Johar]], [[Kenzo]]’s friend. There are a few other grumbles around the table, mostly about food and how it is scarce now, with the army camp and the refugees. 

After dinner, they discuss the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]] with [[Johar]]; the clues and information he imparts are in [Seeker's Journal](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1S5M1wm5WHlFc2Zatn9YepfmNutGdjgSdo0oiTxPUWa4/edit). They also briefly discuss the Chardonian presence, which seems to [[Johar]] to be just a small contingent of mages, and [[Saka]], who [[Johar]] has not heard of. 

The next morning, after breakfast, the party meets [[Basu]] at his workshop and are led to the entrance to the [[Elven Arborea Workshop]] beneath the monastery, with three vials of prepared oil that must be placed near the leakage from [[Arborea]] to charge, before they can be used to construct magic items with extradimensional spaces. 

Proceeding down the pitch black corridor, the party emerges in a room lit by the dim glow of bioluminescent fungi, with pillars decorated in Elvish script running down both sides of the cavern. What was once an entrance is blocked by a cave in at the far end. After dealing with some poisonous mold that launches a cloud of toxic spores, and an ooze that looks like wet stone, they read enough of the script on the pillars to learn one side of the room discusses [[Arborea]], of nature untamed and wild, and the other [[Pandemonium]], the plane of madness, said to be the home of the [[Mad One]], the embodied avatar of [[Jinnik]].

Continuing through the doors, the party comes to an open room with three passages, one straight ahead, one to the left, and one to the right. The right hand side of the chamber is filled with slightly pulsating red fungal-looking protrusions. As the party enters, the protrusions seem to be safe and friendly, until they attack [[Seeker]] and [[Wellby]], stealing memories from each of them. [[Wellby]] stays to fight while [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]], still under its charm, continue, prompting [[Seeker]] to try to use Suggestion on [[Wellby]] to get him to leave well enough alone. 

Eventually [[Wellby]] relents, and the party moves down the corridor to the weak point, when they are attacked by oozing slime molds that drop from the ceiling. The acidic slimes corrode their weapons as they attack, leaving [[Seeker]]’s armor damaged and [[Kenzo]]’s staff nearly destroyed. 

Finally, the party reaches the room where the energy of [[Arborea]] is strongest, a point surrounded by pillars of stone. [[Seeker]] uses Clairvoyance to see a giant worm-like creature with antenna and many little legs (a giant velvet worm) curled up around the weak point, waiting in ambush. Approaching cautiously, [[Wellby]] manages to catch a glimpse of it through the cracks and reach into its mind, sensing its desperate hunger for a giant cricket. In a moment of brilliance, he tosses the [[Obsidian Fly]] from [[Agata]]’s lair out, speaking the command word as he does. The velvet worm attacks the fly, encasing it in some glue-like substance and moving in to feed. While it is distracted, [[Seeker]] turns it into a regular earthworm, giving the party time to charge the vials and run before it shifts back. As the vials charge, the moisture and oppressive, heavy air of the place seem to lift, and the party returns to the surface, although without investigating the rest of the chambers. 

We end as the party emerges, successful, with the vials of extraplanar energy, into the morning sun in the [[Lakan Monastery]]. ---

The session starts as the party emerges from the [[Elven Arborea Workshop|Elven ruins]] beneath the [[Lakan Monastery]], charged vials full of the energy of the plane of [[Arborea]] in hand. [[Basu]], eagerly waiting, takes the party to his workshop, where he describes various magical items he can construct with this energy, including a very fancy tent he once constructed that looked like just a small patch of canvas but could hold twenty people comfortably. The party decides they want a [[Portable Hole]], and leaves with the promise that [[Basu]] will have it ready in two weeks.

After speaking with [[Basu]], the party heads to the library where they meet [[Kassi]]. She has a map for them, now a bit late to be useful in their mission, but still of interest as the Elven runes decorating the pillars in the entrance hall are translated here. After some discussion of the [[Elves|elves]], the conversation turns to questions. [[Kenzo]] asks about stories of [[Rai]], and while [[Kassi]] knows of him she must search for more information that may be useful. [[Seeker]] asks about [[Pandemonium]], and where the weak spot to that plane may be (“nearby, but not here,” [[Kassi]] says). [[Delwath]] asks of gods who have lost their followers, and again [[Kassi]] will look into it, although the name [[Anida]], the First and the Last, is familiar to her, as the name among people of the north before [[Drankor]] for the creator gods referred to as [[Shurat]] and [[Sampa]] by the [[Dunmar]], and [[Arha]] and [[Malik]] by the Drankorians. Finally, [[Wellby]] asks for maps. After some more conversation, the party departs for lunch and discussion, leaving [[Kassi]] to her tasks.

After lunch the party leaves for [[Tokra]], taking rooms at [[Kirian’s]], a major inn near the market square that is popular with merchants and traders. Here, the party converses briefly with [[Kirian]], learning that a Chardonian [[Servius]] was here some time ago; he was studying in the [[Archives]], and left a month or two ago for [[Darba]], on the coast. [[Kirian]] also knew of [[Vola]], who stayed for a bit at his inn. After discussion in their rooms, the party then leaves to speak with the head priestess and civil administrator of [[Tokra]], [[Kaleha]]. 

After introductions, the party learns from [[Kaleha]] that [[Saka]], the old master of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Bhishma Mystai]] who refused to travel east, travels with her family in the plans to the north of [[Tokra]], herding horses. She is probably no more than a few days' journey from the city. While talking to [[Kaleha]], they also discuss the situation at the [[Archives]], and the generally less than ideal situation in [[Tokra]], where food is scarce and a sickness among the horses some weeks ago trapped many refugees in town who might have otherwise left to return to the plains. Finally, [[Wellby]] and [[Kenzo]] reveal that Nayan [[Sura]] has returned; [[Kaleha]] is initially suspicious, but perhaps swayed by [[Wellby]]’s exhortation to take the time to pray before deciding any course of action. 

Finally, the party heads to the [[Archives]] to speak with [[Ardan]] and learn more about what happened here. [[Ardan]] seems on the incompetent side, but shows the party material left behind: the notes from the archivist [[Govir]], who was working on a book about the divine legitimacy of the [[Nayan Dynasty]], and the last set of items the head scribe was copying when he disappearing. [[Govir]]’s notes focus on five events, all Dunmari victories that [[Govir]] claims would have been defeats but for the intervention of the gods: the [[Second Hobgoblin War]], [[Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] from [[Tokra]], the [[Battle of Shrevandurg]], the [[Defeat of the Plague Trees]], and the [[Summer of Red Storms]]. There is little information about any of these events, just lists of scribbled notes and ideas and references. 

The items the head scribe was copying when he went missing are a faded, crumbling sheaf of letters originally written on poor paper that is decaying and needs to be copied over. They are copies of letters from a [[Ila]] to [[Yarad|Samraat Nayan Yarad]]. From context, Ila seems to have been the local garrison commander responsible for the defense of [[Tokra]] in the aftermath of the [[Second Hobgoblin War]]. There are about 50 letters, from the 21st-24th years of the reign of [[Yarad|Samraat Nayan Yarad]], in the 67th-69th years of the Nayan Dynasty. Many are already difficult to read, and most seem to concern raids against [[Hobgoblins]] of the [[Blackened Claw]] tribe. One describes the discovery of a strange cult that had set up a base of operations in an old Dunmari fort about 10 miles north of the city. The place was hard to find -- those who approached seemed to grow confused, sometimes attacking their companions in madness. There was one approach that seemed safe, which I have carefully mapped and given to my troops, and somebody in handwritten annotations has written here, cf bundle 24, implying that bundle 24 contains another depiction of these events, and likely [[Dunmari map of Pandemonium ruins|the map]]. 

According to [[Ardan]], [[Govir]] kept to himself, mostly spending time with the head scribe (also missing) and the other two scribes who were killed, their throats ripped out as if by a mad beast. But, [[Ardan]] says he did occasionally go talk to the retired soldiers that frequent [[Darshana's Caravanserai]], as well as the [[Dwarves]] of the Hardstone clan who help maintain the building the [[Archives]] are in.

While discussing with [[Ardan]] further, the topic of conversation turns to [[Jinnik]] and the [[Mad One]]. [[Ardan]] reports a rumor (which [[Seeker]] also has remembered), that somehow [[Jinnik]] is connected to the curse of lycanthropy. [[Seeker]], who is widely read, recalls that curing lycanthropy is not an easy proposition: you need powerful magic (the remove curse spell), plus a token of the person’s past life before they were cursed, something to pull them back. Or, you can substitute the blessing of a god for one of those two things. 

We end with the party having finished dinner and discussion back at [[Kirian’s]], returning to the [[Archives]] as the sun sets and the full moon rises, but still undecided on the exact course of action to take. ---

Our session begins as the party crosses [[Jita]]’s Square, leaving [[Kirian’s]] after dinner and heading for the [[Archives]], to keep watch of signs of werewolves in the night, as the full moon rises. At the [[Archives]], the party debates what to do, while [[Ardan]] summons extra guards. During the debate, the party hears a piercing howl, cut short. After initially splitting up to cover more ground, the party reconvenes in the basement of the [[Archives]], where the Hardstone clan quarters are and the howls are coming from. 

A werewolf has broken loose from some chains, and despite the [[dwarves]] telling the party to go, they stay and subdue it without damage. [[Fallthra Hardstone]] runs sobbing to the dwarven boy that the stunned werewolf shifts into – her son [[Dag Hardstone]], cursed with lycanthropy in the attack on the archive some weeks ago. He started feeling the effects a few nights ago as the moon waxed towards full, but Fallthra, her husband [[Delig Hardstone]], and her brother [[Morkral Hardstone]] thought they could handle it somehow. After Dag is subdued, [[Delwath]] communes with his patron, who still has some divine connection, and is able to restore Dag to himself. At this point, [[Kenzo]] returns to check on the monastery, while the rest of the party sleeps in the [[Archives]], keeping watch through the night. 

In the morning, the party meets at [[Darshana's Caravanserai]] outside the west gates of [[Tokra]], to try to learn more about [[Govir]]’s comings and goings from the old soldiers he swapped stories with there. [[Darshana]] points them to a small group of older veterans who she says [[Govir]] hung around with. One of them, [[Ashar]], missing an eye from his time fighting gnolls during the [[Summer of Red Storms]], is happy to chat. He tells the stories of his battles that summer, and then moves on to speak of [[Govir]]. He came to chat about a month ago, asking about strange old forts north of the city. He had brought some map that he said was a clue, as well as records of the battle against the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]]. He wanted to go explore the ruins to find out how the gods protected the soldiers that fought for [[Dunmar]] there, saying the gods would protect him too. After some discussion of the fort, [[Ashar]]’s friend revealed he had snuck there on a dare as a child, but it was horrible – nightmares for weeks, imagining killing his friends and being pleased with himself for it. 

After speaking with [[Ashar]] the party decides to head north, looking for [[Saka]] and investigating the fort. But as they return to [[Kirian’s]] to leave word, they are greeted by a small patrol from the Dunmari army, summoning them to come speak with the commander of the army, [[Illyan]]. The captain of the patrol, [[Amay]], agrees to give the party a few moments in their quarters to get organized. During this time [[Seeker]] casts clairvoyance on the commander’s tent, seeing him reading papers after breakfast, and then hearing a discussion where he is asking what is taking his men so long to get back with the party. He then notices a ring on his finger glowing, swears, and gets the Chardonian mage, [[Drusa]], who sees the clairvoyance sensor. 

The party then goes to meet with [[Illyan]]. When they arrive, the camp is on alert, and [[Drusa]], the mage, tells them they may not enter carrying magic or weapons due to a recent spying attempt on the commander. Everyone refuses to comply, until [[Kenzo]] resolves the standoff by agreeing to go in himself, without magic or weapons. 

Meeting with [[Illyan]], [[Kenzo]] admits to the clairvoyance, convincing the commander that this was a reasonable precaution given everything they have faced with [[Agata]] and the dangers of [[Story about Hags|hags]]. [[Illyan]] is angry with the party for the spying and their refusal to even meet the demands to speak with him, but he senses the godly presence on [[Kenzo]] and decides not to kill him for the capital crime of spying on an army commander in the field. [[Illyan]] has summoned the party because the high priestess of [[Tokra]], [[Kaleha]], has prayed and received a vision from [[Sonkar]] that to her suggests the gods greatest desire is to avoid Dunmari fighting Dunmari. [[Kaleha]] has tasked [[Illyan]] with finding out what [[Sura]] wants, and whether she will agree to a truce to put the matter of the rightful ruler of [[Dunmar]] in the hands of the gods. He tasks the party with bringing [[Sura]] this message of truce. 

The party decides to use their scroll of sending to avoid the potentially long journey across the plains. [[Seeker]] sends the message: “Kahela knows. Offers truce: stay east of river, they will stay west while priests discern gods' will. [[Sonkar]] dreads war. Accept? Send messenger, safety promised.” [[Sura]] replies, “I also wish to know the gods’ will. I do not know how their will will be known. But until then, I will not fight.” This is enough to satisfy [[Illyan]] for now, and he gives the party permission to continue on their business, but to let him know when they return to town from their journey north.

Heading north of [[Tokra]], the party decides after some debate to at least briefly investigate the old ruins before turning upriver to look for [[Saka]]. Cutting across the plains, [[Wellby]]’s sharp eyes and halfling luck turn up footprints and claw prints in the dry earth. Turning south to follow the trail, the party comes to a small depression in the ground with a small pile of rubble and stone at the southern end. [[Seeker]]’s sharp eyes and familiarity with stone and earth reveal that the rubble hides a hidden tunnel heading southeast, towards the city a thousand feet or so away. After debating how to avoid the crossbow trap pointed at the rubble, [[Seeker]] eventually just digs through the dirt to drop into the tunnel from above. The party travels some ways underground, until they come to a steel door. As [[Delwath]] looks through the door to reveal a room with four large, grotesque statues, the session ends as the party swings the door open and the statues’ heads turn in alarm. ---

Our session begins as the party opens the door at the end of the long tunnel, stepping into a room with four grotesque animal statues, all bizarre hybrids: a crab on a lion’s body, a goat head on a snake body, a snake head on a rearing wolf, and a bear-like creature with bat wings and axebeak legs. Although the initial strategy of total darkness fails as the statues can sense intruders in the dark, eventually they are defeated and the party begins to explore the lair.

Stepping through the secret door to a hallway, the party hears two guards, and a brief attempt at diplomacy is thwarted as the guards shift into werewolves as soon as they realize intruders are present. After a brief fight – during which a larger, stronger werewolf steps out from guard duty to join – the party searches the place. They discover a pair of prison cells: [[Govir]] is locked in one, and a [[Hada|recently-deceased body]] is tossed in the other. After [[Govir]] is freed, the party learns he has been imprisoned for a month. The werewolves discovered him snooping around the old ruins of the Drankorian fort guarding a weak point in the world connecting to the plane of [[Pandemonium]], and followed him back to the [[Archives]]. They attacked and stole [[Dunmari map of Pandemonium ruins|the map]], and kidnapped him to explain it. The map shows a path to approach a gash in the center of the ruined fort that leads underground, but the Fraternity has yet to figure out how to interpret this map, for each time they have tried to approach the ruins they have gotten lost, or confused, or dazed and enraged, and have not been able to progress. Why they desire to reach the ruins so much, [[Govir]] did not know. Further questioning revealed that [[Govir]] could not remember last night, but feared he had been transformed and killed and eaten [[Hada]].

While [[Delwath]] rests and talks to [[Govir]], [[Seeker]] scouts ahead with clairvoyance, learning that the presumed leader and several more guards are having lunch, and the guards will return soon. The party sets a trap, which includes [[Seeker]] animating the wood and rope [[Ladder]] that leads into the subbasement. The next two guards are dispatched quickly, with the help of the animated [[Ladder]], and the party decides to assault the leader as soon as possible. 

The battle is joined and the leader is defeated, but not before summoning aid from four additional werewolves, leading to a dangerous fight during which [[Kenzo]], [[Seeker]], and [[Delwath]] are bitten. The animated [[Ladder]] proves to be a valiant ally and despite being torn at by werewolves it fights hard and loyally. The leader tries to escape part way through the battle, leaving his minions to fight the party, but as he transforms into a aqueous form and slips through the wall, [[Delwath]] and [[Kenzo]] both strike him, the final blow being dealt from [[Seeker]]’s runic inspiration exploding as [[Kenzo]] strikes. But eventually the werewolves are all dead, and the quiet settles over the building as the party takes a moment to gather their breath before beginning to search the place.---

Our session begins with a flashback to [[Govir]], hiding in the basement of the werewolves’ lair, [[Govir's Story|dwelling on the past month]]. 

We return to the adventurers as the party starts to search the bodies and the lair, and inspect their wounds. The search is interrupted by the sounds of something pounding against the door that [[Wellby]] barred shut, and then a crash as a wolf leaps through the window. The wolf is quickly followed by a woman, who starts to shift, and another wolf. As the battle is engaged, two [[Dwarves]] arrive, having been chasing the werewolves. One is a familiar face, [[Riswynn]] . The other is the retired adventurer and now innkeeper of [[The Iron Swan]], [[Vistra Fireforge]], wearing plate armor and carrying a giant maul. After a few moments the final werewolves are dispatched, with the aid of the newcomers.

In the aftermath of the battle the party learns that [[Riswynn]] came to [[Tokra]] after a group of merchants arrived in [[Tharn Todor]] and turned to werewolves, attacking the city. Once subdued and healed, the [[Dwarves]] learned they had been attacked by a pack of wolves outside [[Tokra]], and [[Riswynn]] traveled to investigate, meeting up with [[Vistra Fireforge]] in the city. After speaking with the Hardstones at the [[Archives]], they had learned the party was in town and tracked them down. 

The party searches the bodies and the papers, uncovering what seem to be calculations about the moon and calendars, as well as a key and what seems to be a prophecy written in an unknown language, that [[Delwath]] reads:

*When the sixth moon rises in the betrayer sky,*
*When the deepest echo of madness is nigh,*
*In the ancient cave of the [[Mad One]]'s soul.*
*Thirteen brethren, thirteen prayers,*
*Thirteen cold iron spears prepared,*
*Will bring forth the howl of empty despair.*
*And [[Jinnik]]'s curse will claim the land.*

While searching the lair, they also uncover a giant calendar painted on the wall of the master bedroom that seems to be counting down days until August 1st, the next full moon, and some scattered coins and trinkets. 

After [[Riswynn]] heals [[Kenzo]] of suspected lycanthropy, she goes with [[Wellby]] to search the basement again for whatever the leader’s key opens, while [[Vistra Fireforge]] keeps onlookers from getting curious and the rest of the party takes a short rest. In the basement, [[Wellby]] finds a secret door hidden by an illusory wall. Inside is a small room with a locked chest, and a table with a map spread out on it. As [[Wellby]] opens the chest, poison gas pours out. [[Riswynn]] jumps on the table to get above it, while [[Wellby]] dashes out of the room. After some debate about how to rescue [[Riswynn]] and get the stuff out of the chest, [[Delwath]] uses mage hand to pass the [[Raven Whistle]] to [[Riswynn]], letting her fly over the gas; [[Delwath]] also retrieves some items from the chest, including an [[Ivory Scroll Cap]] that looks very familiar. As the party regroups, they decide to excavate a pit for the gas to pool in in order to get the rest of the stuff from the chest. 

Finally, at about 4:30 in the afternoon, the party leaves the lair, [[Vistra Fireforge]] remaining behind on guard until [[Kaleha]] can be notified. [[Kenzo]] goes to speak with [[Kaleha]] to let her know of the events of the day, while the rest of the party escorts [[Govir]] back to the [[Archives]], where [[Riswynn]] cures him of his lycanthropy. 

[[Kaleha]] is shocked as she is not sure where the werewolves could have come from, given that anyone bearing [[Jinnik]]’s curse should have been turned away by [[Shakun]]’s protection. She speculates that [[Chardon]] is the source, perhaps unaware, or momentarily forgetting in her shock, that [[Shakun]]’s protection was inoperative for months. She relays rumors from a hundred years ago of werewolves in [[Tokra]], before the protections of [[Shakun]] were complete, and invites [[Kenzo]] to return for dinner with his companions. 

In the [[Archives]], the party regroups while [[Riswynn]] heals [[Govir]] and [[Delwath]] organizes the papers and notes in the strange language, not able to make much sense of them but translating them for [[Govir]] to interpret later. The notes on the prophecy are a bit clearer, in particular what seems to be someone’s note to themselves: “We must find a way past the Dunmari's maze, and we must find a way to get to the Dunmari city without attracting attention. Maybe the old witch can help, if I can find something to trade worthy of her.” The party also receives a copy of the letter that [[Servius]] found, from [[Ardan]]: [[Archives Letter]].

At dinner with [[Kaleha]], the conversation focuses on the werewolves, the old fort and the connection to [[Pandemonium]]. [[Kaleha]] vows to send guards to keep watch on the place, and the party also tentatively agrees to investigate on their way north. From [[Kaleha]], they also learn that the building the werewolves established as their lair was in the northern part of the city that was somewhat run down and abandoned, and now filled with refugees. She notes that if the city were not full of refugees, a large group of strangers probably would not have been able to set up a base unnoticed. 

As the dinner breaks up and the party goes to a well-deserved rest, they agree that they would tell [[Kaleha]] if they find anything, and turn in for the night, planning on awakening early in the pre-dawn light to search for signs of werewolves.---

We begin as the party wakes in the pre-dawn light to search for signs of werewolves. Heading back to the lair of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], the guards there report no disturbances. While all seems quiet, the party decides to exit through the secret tunnel, and perhaps investigate the ruins of the Drankorian fort near the weak point to [[Pandemonium]] on their way north. 

Traveling a few hours from the tunnel exit, with no sign of fresh tracks, they stop to magically spy on the ruins with clairvoyance before approaching any closer than a half-mile vantage point. With [[Seeker]]’s magical eye, the party sees the interior of the one occupied tower, partially ruined but with intact walls, for the most part. There are three people camped here: one is sleeping on a straw mat, one is keeping watch, and one, in ragged clothes and tied to a post with a long rope, is muttering inanities to himself. 

The party begins to sneak closer, and while [[Wellby]], [[Kenzo]], and [[Delwath]] move silently and swiftly towards the tower ruins, [[Seeker]] and [[Riswynn]] are not so quiet. By the time the party is within 50 feet of the camp, the people are alerted. 

As the party rushes forward into combat, it becomes clear that these are werewolves. The party attempts to intimidate them into surrender, in part by warning them the rest of the werewolves are dead, and their plot is ended. This seems to have the desired effect on the two regular werewolves, one of whom runs (only to be chased down and knocked unconscious by [[Kenzo]]) and one of whom, restrained by [[Seeker]]’s quicksand, cowers and tries to hide. However, the muttering one in the ragged clothes looks up and grabs a silver dagger, while muttering about how it is not time, it is too soon, the way is not prepared, and slits his own throat. As he falls to the ground, his body begins to grow mouths and the blood congeals into some gibbering beast, while a shadow whispering about madness and secrets emerges from the mists. 

The party quickly engages these new threats, which seem to fight in large part by confusion. Reaching into the minds of the party, it stuns them, turns them against each other, culminating in a nasty slash from [[Wellby]] at [[Delwath]], cutting extra sharp with the magic of [[Wellby]]’s [[Vicious Shortsword|blade]], acquired from the leader of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]]. However, slowly the party chips away at these creatures, and before anyone dies the enemies are dispatched, the last blow dealt by [[Kenzo]]’s fists of planar power, although not before [[Riswynn]] finds herself lured into the mists by the sound of irresistible voices. However, she is rescued by quick use of mage hand from [[Delwath]] to tie a rope around her waist, and a solid pull from [[Seeker]] and [[Delwath]] together, the combination of them barely strong enough to jolt [[Riswynn]] out of her daze. 

As the fog of combat clears, the party searches the camp, finding another seven ritual spears, and retreats a bit, out of sight of the fogs of the [[Pandemonium]] rift, to interrogate the prisoners. 

The [[Dunmari werewolf woman|woman]] was apparently a Dunmari, a refugee living in the camps outside [[Tokra]], an unwilling convert cursed with lycanthropy a few months ago, and brought into the cult by convincing her their was no cure, she had no choice. Promised a cure, she is willing to speak with the party. She says there was one other recent convert, a man named [[Umber]], also a Dunmari, but the rest were from the east. She also seems to feel like when the one who cursed her is near, she cannot think as clearly and the curse is stronger in her mind. She tells them a bit of the plan, that the mad one who killed himself was meant to be the sacrifice that would summon [[Jinnik]]’s avatar, give the curse of lycanthropy new strength and power. 

The [[Werewolf Prisoner|man]] is less cooperative. He was one of the members of the cult that traveled from the east, and is not willing to speak, until [[Seeker]]’s magic turns his mind and he opens up, [[The Werewolf Prisoner's Tale|speaking of his history]].

As the party finishes interrogating the captives, the story of the past few months becomes clear. The leader of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] found the [[Things/Artifacts of Power/Scepter of Command|scepter]], somewhere near or in [[Kharsan]], and traded it to [[Agata]] in exchange for her help getting them unnoticed into [[Tokra]]. This required two things: a way to create a refugee crises, and a way past [[Shakun]]’s maze. [[Agata]] gave the werewolf cult leader a scroll to summon a demon in order to provoke a border crises, and implemented her plan to lure [[Cintra]] out of [[Karawa]] with [[Heart of Shakun]] in order to lower [[Shakun]]’s defenses and allow the werewolves, and the gnolls created by the demon, into [[Dunmar]]. While the prisoner did not know all the details, you recall that [[Agata]] had a deal with the [[Centaurs]] to not travel or interfere in the north, and probably wanted to meet the letter, if not the spirit, of that agreement by putting as much distance between her and the gnolls as possible (although she also obviously twisted some for her own purposes, such as guarding the entrance to [[Shakun’s Wellspring]]).

With the sun climbing towards noon, the party escorted the prisoners back to [[Tokra]]. We end as the party splits up, [[Riswynn]] staying in [[Tokra]] in charge of the prisoners, while [[Delwath]], [[Kenzo]], [[Wellby]], and [[Seeker]] get their gear and mounts and head north in search of [[Saka]]. ---

## Narrative
The session began with the party waking up in the intact temple of the ruined fort, a sense of calm and peace permeating the area after the defeat of the zombie hobgoblin and the destruction of the cursed obsidian focus. After a little while spent in further exploration, as well as sketching the face of the [[Arcus|petrified explorer]] and briefly debating heading back in the tunnels to try to tame a cockatrice, the party set off for [[Karawa]]. Before leaving, [[Seeker]] studies the tunnel a bit and learns that it is relatively old, at least a few months and maybe more, and created by a creature. Taking the relics found in the temple (including the small [[Aagir's Everlight|spearpoint statue]] enchanted with continual light), the [[Black Iron Staff]] inscribed with the words: "I bind you to the black wind, I bind you to my flame, I bind you in my power until the sun fails and the moon is dead" in Draconic, what looks like a holy symbol relating to Cha’mutte (made of black pearl and polished silver in a twisted flame design), as well as the [[Floating Disc Coin|golden floating coin]] and a [[Horn of Silent Alarm|horn engraved with a running horse design]], the party leaves. 

Traveling back to [[Karawa]] took about 3 days at a fast, but not exhausting, pace. Arriving in the early afternoon on March 29th, the town has changed. Lots of people -- not just Dunmari -- have arrived for the Festival, and the markets and games that accompany it, and a large tent city has grown up on the outskirts of town. The caravanserai is bustling, and there is more activity and trade happening in [[Karawa]] than any of you had seen since arriving in what was a sleepy town. 

RIght away, the party finds Elder [[Kisa]], and reports to her that they seem to have destroyed the source of the disturbances. [[Kisa]] has been quite worried, as news of several more attacks have come into town with travelers returning for the festival. [[Kisa]] is not able to tell them much about the staff, and seems taken aback by the Draconic writing on it, directing them to [[Candrosa]]. She does, however, talk about the [[Summer of Red Storms]], a time about 40 years ago when some half-human, half-hyena creatures rampaged across the border for two months before they were stopped. She also tells them the sketch of the [[Arcus|petrified explorer]] is not someone from [[Karawa]], and directs them to [[Ikram]] to learn more about him. As they leave, she tells them that the town will pay for their stay at [[Ikram’s]] while they are here, in thanks for the aid they provided the town.

Heading to the caravanserai, the party meets [[Ikram]], who is eager to sit and talk and share stories and meet new people. [[Ikram]] tells them a bit about the petrified explorer. His name was [[Arcus]], and he passed through town maybe a month ago. Kept to himself, and didn’t stay long (and wasn’t the first stranger to come through over the winter; several other quiet, silent types had passed through). [[Ikram]] recalls that [[Arcus]] spoke with a foreign accent, and paid with unusual coin that [[Kenzo]] recognized from the description as Chardonian. [[Arcus]] was interested in artifacts and was asking who might be able to identify them, and was directed to [[Jasu]], the smith. From [[Ikram]], they also learned that [[Alesh]] is considered the local expert in Dunmari history and especially artifacts people turn up on the road, and they heard more news of people who were attacked by beasts. [[Akan]], who the party met at the [[Gomat]] oasis, made it safely to town with his surviving family. Another herder, [[Devana]] and his family, were attacked by axebeaks and lost several family members.

After a bit more conversation with [[Ikram]] about lighter subjects, including the upcoming axebeak riding competition before the [[Festival of Rebirth]], the party headed for [[Jasu]]’s shop, to ask about [[Arcus]]. Ending up back at [[Ikram’s]] with [[Jasu]], the party talks about [[Arcus]]. [[Jasu]] tells them [[Arcus]] was asking about artifacts, especially things dating from the [[Great War]]. He left a couple of spear points with [[Jasu]], silvered, and asked if he would haft them to wooden shafts so they could be used. It sounded like [[Arcus]] expected to be back in town in a few weeks at most, and [[Jasu]] thought it strange he had not returned. The silvered spearpoints were odd, too -- hard to work with and resistant to forging. 

Leaving [[Jasu]] to his dinner, they head to say hello to a group of halflings -- marked by their colorful wagons -- in town for the Festival and markets. The matriarch of the group introduces herself as [[Bree Charmheart]], and welcomes the party to sit and chat for a bit. After some small talk with [[Wellby]], reflected on their shared Sembaran origins, she seems to get increasingly chilly and unwelcoming. [[Wellby]] asks her about her sick companion, and she acts like they have overstayed their welcome in a short time. Just before the party leaves, a [[Ander Charmheart|disheveled, unkempt halfling]] staggers out of one of the wagons, looking around dazed and confused but with an incongruous look of joy on his face. As the party hurries away, [[Wellby]] tells them that this disheveled halfling was talking to him, talking about the master, saying “The master is waiting. You'll find joy with the master, the master wants you to come and join us. Over and over and over asked him to name the master and he said the master is my master, Master will consume the world and bring us joy.”

At this point, the party splits up before bed. [[Delwath]], [[Seeker]], and [[Wellby]] head to the oasis to meditate and try to get insight from [[Shakun]], while [[Kenzo]] continues to talk and drink with [[Ikram]]. About 10:30 or 11 at night, [[Candrosa]] walks out of the temple of [[Shakun]], sees most of the party, and sends [[Wellby]] to get [[Kenzo]] at the inn, where [[Wellby]] proceeds to attempt an ancient halfling trick to sober you up quick involving three eggs and a stick.

Eventually the party gathered at the oasis and the temple, seeing a man on a horse in warrior gear ride past leaving the temple as they are assembling (this is [[Havdar]], a warrior who reported the rumors of hyena-humanoids attacking to the south to [[Candrosa]]). [[Candrosa]] ushered them into a small room to the side of the entryway of the [[Temple of Shakun]]. As the party began to talk with [[Candrosa]], it became clear he was nervous and hiding something. When asked directly, he seemed almost relieved, but also uncertain as to whether he could trust the party, and almost struggling with himself as to how much to reveal. After hearing the stories of why the party is there, and casting Zone of Truth and asking them if they are here to aid or hinder [[Karawa]], he begins to talk, telling the party about the magic of [[Shakun]] that protects the borders of [[Dunmar]], creating illusions and misdirection preventing enemies from finding their way in the desert. He talks about how this magic has kept [[Dunmar]] safe for many generations, and then about how [[Shakun]] seems to have abandoned the Dunmari. He is terrified and asks for their aid, saying “If [[Shakun]] cannot protect us, we will have to rely on more mundane forces.” During the conversation, he also passes along two additional rumors, one about a never-ending lightning storm, and one about rampaging hyena-humanoids, but says there will be time to talk more in the morning.

We begin as the party leaves [[Tokra]] just before lunchtime, finally heading north to look for [[Saka]] on the plains, after seemingly vanquishing the last remnants of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]]. Heading north along the river, the first afternoon of travel is hot, but uneventful, the first night notable only for [[Kenzo]]’s recurrent dreams of being underground, near what sounds like a metal forge, the sound of hammers seemingly keeping him safe from some nameless danger of bloodlust and fear. 

Another morning and early afternoon of travel is uneventful, until in the mid-afternoon the party meets [[Kiran]] and his family, camped along the riverbank. From [[Kiran]] they learn a bit more about [[Saka]], that she is wary of outsiders and that she is camped to the north. He also speaks of his sadness at the loss of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], for they used to travel the lands and tell and collect stories, but have not been seen of late. 

After departing [[Kiran]]’s camp, the party travels the rest of the day before setting camp uneventfully in the plains. Again, [[Kenzo]]’s dreams, just a faint echo of the sounds of the forge and hammers from the prior nights, are all that mark the evening. 

The next day passes quickly in travel, the party realizing around dusk that they were perhaps heading a bit too west, for [[Saka]]’s camp is visible due east. After another evening’s rest on the arid plains of north [[Dunmar]], the party approaches [[Saka]]’s camp the next morning, asking to speak with her.

After briefly speaking with [[Jita of Tokra|Jita]], Saka's niece and helper, the party is led into her dark, smoky tent, where she has been waiting. After introducing themselves, the party explains that they are here looking for answers about the fate of the Mystai of [[Bhishma]] on the blasted plains thirty years ago, and the connection to [[Rai]]. [[Seeker]] gifts [[Saka]] a copy of "[[Legendary Gates of Kenzo]], a book in which one selects one’s own adventure.”

[[Saka]] is skeptical, wondering how many stories [[Kenzo]] has collected for the [[Hall of Stories]], and dubious of heroes in general, for her compatriots saw themselves as heroes and all died. She sees [[Dunmar]] as a defense against the darkness, not a great conquering force to cleanse the land of evil, and she mourns the loss of the Mystai, the loss of their stories. After some back and forth, she relents, and tells her story.

It starts with [[Rai]], the great wizard and hero of the [[Great War]], and the final battle against [[Cha'mutte]]. [[Cha'mutte]] was an elder wyrm, a child of [[Shurat]] and [[Sampa]] from before time, and he existed across many planes. When he died, some pieces of these other planes were pulled into Taelgar, leaving seeds of chaos across the blasted plains and the [[Plaguelands]]. The [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Mystai of Bhishma]], while searching for the lost dead, came across these cursed places. 

The Mystai argued, with some believing these could be eradicated, and others instead arguing that [[Dunmar]]’s defenses should be reinforced against incursions from these evil places. Those who wanted eradication traveled far and wide, even to the ruins of [[Drankor]], seeking answers and information. Those who wanted to fortify in defense argued that [[Dunmar]] had always come to ruin when its armies tried to conquer [[Drankor]] itself or the evil lands around it. 

The travelers and the faction arguing for action had found, in [[Drankor]], the hero [[Rai]], or at least a link to him. It is from him that they learned of the seeds of chaos, and devised a plan, to link themselves together and use the energy of the [[Plane of Souls]] to force the seeds of chaos back. [[Saka]] argued against this, feeling it was too risky, pointless heroism for little prospect of gain. But she lost the argument, and her comrades left, never to return. 

As part of their failure, [[Rai]]’s power was also broken or diminished somehow, and some hold that he had had on the land faded. A protection he had cast over the [[Nashtkar]], the blasted plains, was lost, and since then dark things have grown in power. 

With the failure, [[Saka]] fled west, and now trains who she can to keep some remnant of the Mystai alive. She ends her story with a word of advice and warning: there are many people and powers whose lives have been touched by the party, from the trapped god that clings to [[Delwath]] and grants him power, to the [[Giants|giant]] [[Hralgar]], to [[Seeker]]’s [[Frankar|brother]]. She tells the party to tend to these wounds and not go chasing heroics, as the gods have not seen fit to reveal what could possibly separate the planes again and remove the seeds of chaos, and perhaps only [[Shurat]] and [[Sampa]] can do this, as they did once before. And they do not grant or hear prayers. 

The session ends as [[Saka]] answers the party’s questions, and they then turn to discuss amongst themselves the next steps.---

We begin as the party finishes their conversation with [[Saka]], and prepares to return to [[Tokra]] after sharing a meal with [[Saka]] and her family. As they depart, [[Saka]] pulls [[Kenzo]] aside, reminding him not to neglect his duties as a Mystai of [[Bhishma]]. She gives him 10 scrolls that can be used to collect the stories of the people of [[Dunmar]], to be stored in the [[Hall of Stories]] at some point in the future. 

The next two days are spent in uneventful travel south back to [[Tokra]], in the hot, dry, weather, arriving the evening of July 8th, and returning to [[Kirian’s]], where they had been staying. Here, they are given messages from [[Govir]] at the [[Archives]], from [[Fallthra Hardstone]], from [[Kassi]] at the [[Lakan Monastery]], from [[Kaleha]], and from [[Riswynn]]. After meeting up with [[Riswynn]] again, the party returns to [[Kirian’s]] for dinner, as clouds form in the sky for the first time in months. After some discussion of what to do with the captured werewolf, [[Kenzo]] listens to [[Kirian]]’s [[Kirian's Story|story]].

The next day, the party takes care of errands around [[Tokra]]. First, a quick stop at [[The Red Lily Inn]] to check on [[Garret Tealeaf]] and [[Ander Charmheart]] and his family, and then to the [[Archives]]. In the [[Archives]], there are papers and notes spread all over the place, seemingly [[Govir]]’s recent work. The party heads downstairs to the Hardstone’s quarters, where they speak with [[Fallthra Hardstone]]. She has been worried about [[Dag Hardstone]]’s dreams – of a dark woods, in twilight, the sounds of a hunt in the distance. But [[Delwath]] assures her the dreams are safe, the echoes of the god that cured him from lycanthropy. 

The party then goes to talk to [[Govir]]. He has seemingly barely slept since we rescued, and has figured out a lot about the ritual from the notes [[Delwath]] translated. He tells the story, which confirms what the party learned from their captives. He has also found more information in the [[Archives]], not well cataloged or noted, that describe the ritual and the goal of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] from the last time they were in [[Tokra]], many generations ago. [[Govir]] is convinced that the [[Archives]] could be better organized and there is much to learn hidden in the depths of the records and letters here. 

After speaking with [[Govir]], the party briefly speaks with [[Ardan]], convincing him to give [[Govir]] the time and resources to lead a reorganization of the material stored in the [[Archives]], and leaving [[Govir]] with a list of things to try to dig up information about. While it will take some time (months, not weeks), he is dedicated to the cause, and [[Ardan]] is willing to fund several assistants for him. 

Leaving the [[Archives]] to speak with [[Kaleha]], the skies open and the first rains of the monsoon season begin to fall. [[Kaleha]] is very pleased with the rain, and in a good mood. She intends to execute the werewolf for his crimes against the people of [[Tokra]], but wanted to confirm the party did not want him alive for any reason first. 

That afternoon, the party moves to the monastery to wait for their [[Portable Hole]] before leaving for [[Darba]]. The next day is the [[Day of Renewal]], a quiet day in the Dunmari festival cycle, celebrating the first rains of the monsoon each year, and giving thanks to [[Jeevali]] for her sacrifice. 

Over the next few days, the party speaks with [[Kassi]] (details on what she reports are described in [[Research from Kassi]]), and then speaks with Speaker [[Lara]], when she returns from her trip to the east.

Speaker [[Lara]] has traveled east, and spoken with Nayan [[Sura]], drawn, she thinks, by the gods to help make sense of the current moment. But [[Lara]] fears this is a moment that [[Laka]] did not foresee, and does not know exactly what to do. She sees the will of [[Aagir]] in [[Sura]]; [[Aagir]] has always been the force in [[Dunmar]] pushing for war, pushing to drive east and exterminate the evil forces that threaten [[Dunmar]]. But whether this is impulse will lead to safety, or just needless death, [[Lara]] does not know and cannot see. In the past, riding east in force has led to much death, but whether needless is hard to say, and if [[Sura]] summoned the might of [[Aagir]] and rode forth, [[Lara]] fears that [[Dunmar]] may meet a glorious end. [[Nayan Karnas]] is a servant of [[Sonkar]] – a goddess many think cold, perhaps even heartless, for she is the one that sits in judgment of the dead. And yet she is also the one that mourns life cut short the most, the lost potential of the prematurely dead to create art and beauty in the world. 

While a solution is not immediately apparent to Speaker [[Lara]], she has decided to send [[Johar]] to [[Nayahar]] to speak with [[Nayan Karnas]], to try to prevent war at least. However, rumor is that the roads are dangerous now, both from evil that may have slipped in to [[Dunmar]] over the last months, and from the usual banditry that is caused by famine and war. So, she asks the party to escort him, at least as far as the coast. 

We end as the conversation fades and the party agrees that [[Johar]] will come with them to [[Darba]].---

## Notes and Information

- (DR:: 1748-07-13) *(Eudomes Mirror)*: See a the [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision]] in [[The Mirror of the Past]] (recharge:: mirror)

## Narrative

We begin with the tale of the [[The Dunmari Monsoon|monsoons that have just begun]], as the party rests in [[Tokra]], waiting for their [[Portable Hole]] to be ready and to begin the journey to [[Darba]], and planning on wrapping up a few loose ends. The first of which is looking at the [[Pandemonium Scroll|scroll]] associated with [[Pandemonium]], recovered from the lair of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], in [[The Mirror of the Past]]. As [[Seeker]] unrolls the scroll to hold it to the mirror, the runes shift and squirm and reach out to him, but he resists whatever effect might have occurred and [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision|sees the following]].

The next morning, the party explores the giant tree, going so far as to climb to the top, where they see the first buds of the new leaves beginning to appear, and [[Kenzo]] communes with the tree. Despite his wishes, a branch does not fall for him. However, later that afternoon, his old mentor [[Rishi]] gives him a branch from the tree that he had been saving for [[Kenzo]] when he was ready, telling him that it must be shaped into a staff by [[Kenzo]]’s own hand. The rest of the party sells treasure and gets organized for the journey to [[Darba]].

On the morning of July 15th, the party speaks with [[Basu]], who delivers the [[Portable Hole]] along with four rules: 

1) never open an extradimensional portal instead another extradimensional portal; 
2) no fire (or acid, or similar effects) in the hole, because eventually the silk of the cloth itself will burn and the item will be destroyed; 
3) be careful which direction you open it – if you put it on the ceiling everything will fall out; and 
4) don’t rip the material from the outside or especially from the inside, as any tear can rip apart and eject everything inside into a random other plane. 

After some conversation in which [[Basu]] gets increasingly dubious about the safety of handing over the item, he relents and turns over the [[Portable Hole]]. 

The party leaves [[Tokra]] on the morning of July 16th, escorting [[Johar]] and heading northwest on the main trade road before turning south and west in a few days for the direct overland route to [[Darba]]. The first two days are uneventful, as the party rests in inns each night, the main notable landmark a soaring night-glowing single arch bridge of Drankorian make, over a now-seasonal river.

The evening of July 18th, after three days on the road, the party reaches the crossroads. The [[~Crossroads Caravanserai~]] is busy with travelers, including some halflings and a Chardonian. [[Wellby]] speaks with the halflings, brothers, [[Alton Greenleaf]] and [[Lyle Greenleaf]]. They’ve come from the west, heading for [[Tokra]]. They report news of kobold attacks near [[Songara]], hard-to-believe rumors of a dragon on the trail to [[Darba]], and that the Chardonian was traveling with a group of four others that they passed on the road heading west yesterday, all adventurers.

The party then speaks with [[Marcella]]. She tells them that she in here because she is waiting for details from [[Drusa]], in [[Tokra]], about the kobold threat near [[Songara]], which she and her companions have been tasked with dealing with on their way back to [[Chardon]], while the party tells her they are heading south and west to [[Darba]]. As the party exchanges stories for stories, they learn that she and her companions were traveling in the [[Garamjala Desert]] searching for lost ruins of [[Drankor]] buried in the sands. [[Delwath]] gives her the letters from [[Stormcaller Tower]], and she reveals they didn’t find much in the desert, the site of a battle from the time of the [[Great War]] with a few treasures, but none of the Drankorian ruins they hoped to find. [[Marcella]] also speaks of [[Orcs|orcs]]: they found a hunting party, who were chasing free [[Orcs|orcs]] in the name of [[Grash]]. The party tells her about their encounter with [[Grash]], then, and the conversation turns to [[Vola]]. [[Marcella]] traveled with her, and is relieved to hear news of her. [[Delwath]] and [[Marcella]] then trade stories of ancient artifacts: [[Delwath]] speaks of a [[Circlet of Foreknowledge|circlet]] set with a single white gem that gives perfect foreknowledge, and [[Marcella]] speaks of a [[Ring of Undying|ring]] that lets one cheat death forever. 

Finally the conversation turns to the [[Great Library]] and the [[Society of the Open Scroll]]. While [[Marcella]] seems to be quite cagey (lying, according to [[Kenzo]]’s [[Bhishma]]-enhanced sense about stories) about who she has traveled with or knows, she does tell the party that the Society is open to all, and if they make it to [[Chardon]] they should ask after [[Crispus]], a senior archivist in the Library who is in charge of many of the expeditions to collect magical artifacts from the past. 

As the conversation ends and the party talks into the night, [[Johar]] mentions the rumors that [[Nayan Karnas|Karnas]] had made a deal with [[Chardon]] in the past few years, giving them access to the treasures lost in the [[Nashtkar]] in exchange for magical aid. We end as the party turns in for the night, preparing to take the potentially dragon and bandit infested [[Tokra-Darba Road|road]] to [[Darba]] in the morning.---

We begin as the party departs the caravanserai and small settlement at the crossroads where the [[Tokra-Darba Road]] branches west and south from the [[~AncientWestRoad~]]. The first day of travel passes uneventfully, despite the mud and rain, more noticeable now off the ancient Drankorian roads that seem impervious to bad weather.

Towards evening, the party comes to the [[Akela Inn]] and fortification on the road, the last carvanserai until the [[Darba]] hinterlands, more than a hundred miles west. Here, they gather news: rumors of a dragon are everywhere, as are tales of bandits in the [[Copper Hills]]. No travelers have come through for some time, since the messenger who reported the dragon several days ago. One caravan - well guarded - set out west carrying vellum from [[Tokra]] and silk from much further east, but no news has come from either direction since then. While here, the party also speaks with some [[Aagir Mystai]]. The [[Aagir Mystai]] form something of a traveling knighthood of sorts, charged at least in part with keeping the roads safe for trade, and they are waiting for a larger troop to arrive to go sort out the bandits once and for all, and challenge the dragon as well if need be. Although [[Wellby]] attempts to convince them to travel with the party, they refuse, saying they will wait for their companions. [[Kenzo]] then collects [[Amar's Story|the story]] of [[Amar]], the innkeeper. 

The next few days pass in uneventful travel across the increasingly hilly and tree-covered landscape, until a combination of skill (particularly [[Wellby]]’s beast sense ability) and luck leads to the party spotting a bandit ambush well before the bandits see them. [[Wellby]] and [[Delwath]] sneak up behind the bandits, invisible, getting the jump on them. [[Delwath]] intimidates them into submission, and eventually the party peacefully subdues the group of eight bandits that were watching the road here, prepared to ambush travelers who camp for the night. With an offer of money and a share of any treasure, the bandits agree to travel with the party.

At camp that night, [[Kenzo]] listens to [[Justan]]’s [[Justan's Story|story]], the captain of this group of bandits. 

The next day passes uneventfully, but the day after, July 23rd, does not. After a slow morning that includes finding a disemboweled horse on the road, the party is ambushed during the afternoon rains by a pair of wyverns. While [[Kenzo]] is nearly killed by the venom in their stingers, and one bandit does die, the beasts are soon subdued. One wyvern is temporarily rendered harmless by [[Seeker]], who turns it into a turtle. The party decides to keep it in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]. 

As the battle fades and the party begins to recover, they see riding over a low ridge on the north side of the road five adventurers – the Chardonian group traveling with [[Marcella]], from the inn at the start of the session. The Chardonians are attempting to purchase or trade for Drankorian magic. After some back and forth, the session ends as the seeming leader, a hooded man named [[Kadmos]], attempts to speed up negotiation by using magic to place a charm on [[Wellby]], [[Delwath]], [[Seeker]], and [[Riswynn]]; only [[Seeker]] succeeds in resisting the magic, protected by the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]] taken from [[Agata]] Dustmother.---

---

We begin as the party faces off against [[Kadmos]] and his companions, with [[Delwath]], [[Wellby]], and [[Riswynn]] charmed by [[Kadmos]]’ magic. [[Kenzo]], enraged by [[Kadmos]]’ actions, rushes forward, avoiding [[Seeker]]’s attempt to defuse the situation by turning him into a bunny rabbit, but running straight into [[Hektor]]’s halberd before he can launch a flurry of blows at [[Kadmos]]. Despite the slashing attack from [[Hektor]], [[Kenzo]]’s staff and fists land true and he nearly knocks [[Kadmos]] unconscious. Unfortunately, though, [[Hektor]] returns the favor, and [[Kenzo]] is taken down by two quick blows with the halberd.

At this point, both [[Antonia]] and [[Riswynn]] reach over to heal [[Kenzo]], and the violence calms for a moment as the encounter turns to conversation. [[Delwath]] offers to show [[Kadmos]] the [[Ring of Displacement|ring]] from [[Drankor]] he has, and is concerned about [[Kenzo]], as [[Delwath]] is still under the influence of a charm. While the conversation continues, [[Kenzo]] quietly reaches out to [[Wellby]]’s essence and, after a few attempts, breaks the charm that has a hold on him. 

Over time as [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] press the conversation, it slowly becomes clear to everyone that something is up. [[Kadmos]] speculates that the [[Scepter of Command]] may be exerting its influence, although no one lets on that the party is carrying the scepter. [[Antonia]] and [[Wellby]] attempt to make a deal for a map to [[Agata]]’s lair and the [[Ever Spinning Top]], but it doesn’t quite connect. Eventually, the charm wears off, and the Chardonians retreat to a protected magical sphere created by [[Casian]] to rest, while the party leaves towards the wyvern’s lair.

On the road to the abandoned mining town of [[Vandar]], the party finds the ruins of the caravan that left down this road some days ago, carrying silk and paper – much of the silk is salvageable but the paper has been badly damaged by the rain. Upon arriving at the town of [[Vandar]], they find it largely ruined, with an obvious wyvern’s lair in the middle of the town square, and an oozing poisonous swamp with a sleeping ogre of some kind at the base of the hill. The temple is still partially intact, and that is where they set a camp.

That evening, after midnight, a group of the Chardonians attempts to stealthily steal some magic items from the party. However, they are detected, and a battle ensues. [[Marcella]], the main thief, is quickly knocked unconscious and left for dead (“left for chance to decide her fate,” says [[Wellby]]). [[Casian]] and [[Kadmos]] launch an attack, and the battle turns into a vicious exchange of magic. [[Casian]] kills all seven bandits with a fireball, and eventually [[Delwath]] is worn down by a ghost summoned by [[Kadmos]]. 

As everyone approaches the end of their resources and health, and the battle threatens to leave one or more people on both sides dead, [[Marcella]] approaches from down the path, battered but miraculously and luckily recovered. She implores everyone to stop fighting, and [[Kadmos]], badly wounded and nearing death, does not argue. While the conversation is bitter, the parties eventually agree that [[Kadmos]] will take the [[Ever Spinning Top]], and [[Casian]] will pay a wereguild of 25 gold per bandit killed, a total of 175 gp, but [[Marcella]]’s weapons and ring of haste will be returned to her. 

While these negotiations are happening, [[Wellby]] and [[Marcella]] grab a private moment out of sight behind the Wall of Fire summoned by [[Casian]]. After a whispered conversation, [[Marcella]] turns disdainfully away and looks back at [[Wellby]] with anger. But [[Wellby]] has a thoughtful look on his face.---

We begin as [[Kadmos]], [[Casian]], and [[Marcella]] flee, leaving behind the party – near death – and a fire starting in the ruins of the temple, caused by the fireballs slung by [[Casian]] in the fight. In desperation, the party scrambles to flee to safety, finding shelter near the abandoned mines about a half mile away from the city. Here, they spend the night, getting a much needed rest after the difficulties of the evening. 

Waking near noon, the party discusses their options and the events of the night before. [[Wellby]] reports on his conversation with [[Marcella]]: there is something dark at the heart of the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], some power that they have to control people. [[Hektor]], the barbarian, was a sweet boy once, a sailor who liked to sing, but was turned to a servant of [[Kadmos]] through and through. [[Marcella]] was the thief, and was supposed to be the treasure finder, and is worried that if she does not succeed in a score, she will be taken away next, and come out as something not herself. [[Wellby]] gave her his [[Boots of False Tracks]] and maps to help her get to [[Sembara|Sembara]], should she be able to escape.

While discussing the events of the night before, the party convinces [[Johar]] to take charge of the blood money from the Chardonians, and, when he has time, take it to [[Saka]], who will take charge of it and take charge of the mission to track down the families of the bandits. This may take quite some time, given his mission in [[Nayahar]], but he will do his best.

The conversation turns to the situation in [[Dunmar]], and speculation as to how [[Sura]] got in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], whether she was paid and if so by who, or whether she was simply sowing chaos. To help, perhaps, the party starts to investigate items they found in [[Agata]]’s lair in [[The Mirror of the Past]], starting with the [[Ring of Displacement]]. As usual, they see a [[Ring of Displacement Vision|vision of its past]] in the mirror. 

After discussing the scenes in the mirror and the various evidence for ancient Drankorian magic, the party decides to scout the ruins a bit more before turning west to [[Darba]]. [[Wellby]], [[Delwath]], and [[Kenzo]] proceed invisibly to collect the coins and treasure from the lair, and notice while they are doing so the poison troll is awake, and seemingly looking for the wyverns, poking at their lair with a stick. Deciding to sneak up on it and catch it in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], they succeed despite a few mishaps.

With the poison troll trapped, the party headed for the road again, reaching the next waystation and outpost, run by a woman named [[Padma]] in a few days time. Here, they brought welcome news of the wyvern’s demise, and then continued west towards [[Darba]]. Passing through the increasingly settled and lush land of the [[Darba]] hinterlands, in less that two weeks they reached the outskirts of the city, where our session ends. 

Along the way, they looked at one more object in the mirror, the valuable diamond [[Agata]] carried on her person, again [[Extravagant Diamond Vision|seeing a vision of its past]]. ---

We begin as the party reaches [[Darba]], after the journey along the increasingly populated road. Along the way, [[Riswynn]] was able to contact [[Marcella]] on August 8th, the day the party arrived in [[Darba]]. [[Marcella]] said she was hoping to flee the following day, during the battle with [[kobolds]]. As the day ends, the party splits up to enter [[Darba]] – the [[Dwarves]] going together to hope to connect with [[Riswynn]]’s contact from [[Tharn Todor]]; [[Wellby]] heading to find a halfling inn and enquire about ships; and [[Delwath]], [[Johar]], and [[Kenzo]] going to the harbor to try to find [[Johar]] a ship to [[Nayahar]]. 

In a tavern in the dwarven quarter of [[Darba]], [[Riswynn]] and [[Seeker]] meet [[Travok Redpeak]], recently arrived from [[Tharn Todor]]. He tells them about recent events in the north - [[Magran Boulderbeard]]  and about twenty dwarven warriors confronted a group of Chardonian adventurers near [[Raven's Hold]], and drove them off, and then cleared the hold of the creatures dwelling there, some kind of twisted worshippers of mind flayers from the [[Great War]]. The Chardonians were supposedly mercenaries, four [[humans]], a [[lizardfolk]], and a [[Halflings|halfling]], with a large purse to purchase items from the [[Stoneborn]]; but they seemed to have not had much success. [[Magran Boulderbeard]] recently returned to [[Tharn Todor]] ready to lead an army against [[Chardon]], but the council pushed to try diplomacy first. 

Travok also reminds [[Riswynn]], and tells [[Seeker]], the story of the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]]. It was found when the [[Dwarves]] fleeing the destruction of the kingdom of [[Ardith]] at the end of the [[Great War]] reached the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], in a chamber carved and prepared deep beneath the ground, reminiscent of [[Heart of the Mountain]]. When it was first found, it flowed with salt water (some say, the tears of the [[Bahrazel]]; others a memory of the ocean that once covered the land), and marked where [[Tharn Todor]] was constructed. Later, it was taken north by a large rescue mission that went looking for survivors from Ardtih, as many [[Dwarves]] were lost at the beginning of the [[Blood Years]]. It was hoped the Chalice could be a beacon, a guide to survivors who could still be rescued. But tragically, the rescue mission itself was lost, and despite the pain of losing the Chalice, it was decided that no more dwarven lives could be risked in the ruins of [[Ardith]]. Until, in the past year, rumors of its recovery surfaced, and led to [[Chardon]]. 

After telling the story and learning from [[Riswynn]] that diplomacy is not likely a good idea given what she has learned about the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], [[Travok Redpeak]] says he will return to [[Tharn Todor]] with news, and that if [[Riswynn]] finds any information in [[Chardon]] to contact him with her magic. He then takes [[Seeker]] and [[Riswynn]] to the Redpeak clan’s estates, where they meet [[Torgga Redpeak]], the matriarch of the family, and [[Vondal Redpeak]], a mason who is fascinated with the history of [[Darba]]’s stonework. While [[Riswynn]] turns in for the evening, [[Seeker]] makes plans with [[Vondal Redpeak]] for a tour the next day then heads to the docks to meet the rest of the party. 

Meanwhile, [[Kenzo]], [[Delwath]] and [[Johar]] reach the docks, and look around for a ship heading for [[Nayahar]], while [[Wellby]] heads for [[The Green Leaf]], the local halfling inn on the docks, to investigate halfling ships leaving in the next few days. [[Kenzo]] finds a Dunmari ship leaving this evening, on the tide, and heading south, and after some negotiation gets [[Johar]] a berth. After saying goodbyes and wishing him well with his mission, [[Wellby]], [[Delwath]], and [[Kenzo]] meet with [[Harol Silversong]], the captain of the [[Emerald Song]] heading for [[Chardon]], to arrange passage for the next day. 

The next morning, the party splits up to sell treasure, sell the horses, and talk to a few people in town before leaving. [[Kenzo]] takes the horses to the animal yards and gets a good price for them; [[Riswynn]] speaks with [[Finellen Silverstone]], the dwarven antiquities dealer in town; [[Seeker]] gets his tour of the masonry of [[Darba]] from [[Vondal Redpeak]]; [[Wellby]] stays with the halflings; and [[Delwath]] sells treasure around town. In the course of doing so, [[Delwath]] hears rumors from [[Albus]], a Chardonian bookseller, that [[Servius]] was trying to hire mercenaries to explore an pre-Drankorian temple, or perhaps a palace, in the mountains, rumored to be the site of worship to an ancient stone god. Rumor has it that many ancient treasures are hidden there, but no one has returned - whether because they are all turned to stone, as some say, or because they all find fabulous wealth and leave for another life, no one can agree upon. [[Delwath]] also learns that [[Servius]] headed to [[Illoria]], where there are rumors of treasure taken from [[Darba]] during the Illorian occupation in the [[Blood Years]]. 

We end as the party boards the [[Emerald Song]] heading for [[Chardon]], leaving the rumors of the palace or temple in the mountains and the rumors of treasure in [[Illoria]] to explore another day.---

We begin as the party boards the [[Emerald Song]], the halfling ship they will sail on to [[Chardon]]. As the ship departs [[Darba]], the party gets settled and enjoys the view from the deck, before heading to dinner with the captain, some of the crew, and the two other passengers, both halflings.

The party is introduced to the captain, [[Harol Silversong]]; the family elder and songkeeper, [[Ewen Silversong]]; the cook, [[Pearl Copperharp]]; the navigator, [[Lyle Honeyhill]]; and the passengers [[Jasmine Sunmeadow]] and [[Oswalt Tealeaf]], a young married couple. [[Dani Silversong]], the quartermaster and chief trader on the ship, is also there. As dinner starts, conversation touches on the rumors of [[Dunmar]] - both of the party’s exploits, and other tales such as a story of an undead attack across the river [[Shrev]] to the south. [[Oswalt Tealeaf]] is a cousin of [[Garret Tealeaf]]’s, and quite pleased to learn he is alive. Indeed, it was [[Agata]]’s attack on their caravan that turned him to learning archery; in his wanderings he met [[Jasmine Sunmeadow]] outside [[Darba]], and they bonded over a shared love of the wilds and of wandering. [[Jasmine Sunmeadow]] grew up the daughter of the innkeepers of [[The Green Leaf]], the halfling inn in the harbor in [[Darba]]. She liked to wander, to find new plants, and met [[Oswalt Tealeaf]] in her wanderings. Eventually they got married and decided to go seek adventure.

As dinner ends, [[Harol Silversong]] and [[Pearl Copperharp]] take out their instruments, and the party discusses their route with the navigator, [[Lyle Honeyhill]]. Although the halflings offer a more hidden route along the coast, the party decides speed is of the essence. [[Wellby]] also talks with [[Ewen Silversong]] a bit, hearing stories of his journeys across the [[Sea of Storms]] to the mysterious lands to the south, and tales of storm giants lurking in the ocean there. 

Lyle's chart:
![[halfling-chart.png|500]]

The next days pass quietly in the routine of the ship. While a few vessels are spotted – Chardonians and other traders – none come close or threaten to board. After a few days sailing, the [[Emerald Song]] approaches the [[Old Chardon Canal]] that connects the [[Nevos Sea]] to the [[Endless Ocean]] to the north, and cuts many weeks off the sailing time between [[Dunmar]] and [[Chardon]]. Originally built by the Drankorians, it is now managed and run by the [[Chardonian Empire]]. 

Before arriving, [[Riswynn]] magically constructs a small lead box, for [[Wellby]] to store the [[Portable Hole]] in. Everyone but [[Wellby]] climbs into the mirror; [[Wellby]] then stores it in the [[Portable Hole]], which he keeps in the lead box. So only [[Wellby]] sees the scenes of the next day, the journey through the canal.

Before dawn, [[Wellby]] is awakened by an unnatural wind in the sails, and sees on deck an individual wearing sky blue robes with a deep hood shadowing their face. This person has constructed a circle of some powder, and is sitting in the middle of it chanting. As they chant, the powder in the circle floats to the sky and fills the sails. The morning passes this way, watching the landscape flow past, until the ship enters a deep canyon, completely smooth sided, and eventually passes into an open lake that seems to be filling a bowl of stone. Here, the person is the sky blue robes leaves, and another takes their place. With the light of midday, [[Wellby]] catches a brief glimpse of their eyes, which have no iris and are just a sky blue color. By the time the ship exits the canal, it is full dark, the stars emerging. 

During the next few days sail to [[Chardon]], [[Riswynn]] sends another message to [[Marcella]]. She says, “I’m trapped in a cave. [[Kadmos]] thinks its kobolds, but I don’t know how long the deception can last. He thinks I was captured.” 

As the [[Emerald Song]] pulls into the [[Chardon]] docks in the midafternoon, on the 13th day after departing [[Darba]], the session ends.

We begin as the [[Emerald Song]] arrives at [[Chardon]], and the party recalls the two items they looked at in the mirror during the voyage, first the [[Raven Whistle Vision|vision]] of the [[Raven Whistle]], next the [[Chardon Fan Vision|vision]] of [[Agata]]'s [[Chardon Fan]]. 

After a brief discussion about how to approach their time in the city, the party speaks with [[Dani Silversong]], who warns them that magic is regulated, and to be careful. Disembarking separately, the party registers with illegible signatures under the careless eye of the customs’ agent, and then finds tables at a nearby tavern, [[The Salty Squid]], while [[Kenzo]] goes to find [[Kaeso]]. 

After making contact with [[Kaeso]], greeting him warmly and finally realizing the secret [[Kaeso]] would not share with the [[Society of the Open Scroll]] was the magic he learned as a [[Shakun Mystai|Mystai of Shakun]], [[Kenzo]] returns to bring the party to [[Kaeso]]’s house. 

After some very brief introductions, the party and [[Kaeso]] talk a bit about their history and what is happening in [[Chardon]], learning that [[Kaeso]]’s concern these days is the abuse of chalyte. The chalyte trade has been controlled by the Auratan family for at least a generation, and they have used it to become powerful indeed; the current Magistros is of this line. But, in [[Kaeso]]’s eyes, chalyte is dangerous, and there are rumors that those who overuse it become like zombies, their souls burned away. The human cost of the power it gives it too great. 

He doesn’t, however, have any recent contacts in the [[Society of the Open Scroll]]. He was a member, long ago, before he was expelled, and what he remembers is basically a learned society, a debating group, of scholars and explorers. Nothing with a hierarchy or strict organization. But the only one who still speaks to him is his old teacher at the Faculty of Magic, [[Roscelia]]; he arranges a letter asking for a meeting for the party with her.

After dinner, the party contacts [[Marcella]] using Sending and learns that she is safe and heading to the Stoneborn villages to hide and recover, and then contacts [[Vola]] with Sending, arranging to meet her at [[The Thirsty Scholar]], a quiet tavern in the academic quarter. 

[[Vola]] is a little anxious to see the party, unsure of where they left things, but once it becomes clear they are meeting as friends, or at least acquaintances, she relaxes. She agrees to send a letter to [[Dee Wildcloak]] and [[Dain Goldhammer]], the adventurers who explored [[Stormcaller Tower]] before the party (along with their companion, [[Alban]], who was killed), asking them to meet with the party. From [[Vola]] the party learns a bit about the situation with the Society – apparently rich patrons fund many of the treasure hunting expeditions, although some are funded directly by the [[Great Library]]. She spoke poorly of [[Casian]], who would sneer at those beneath his class, and highly of her mentor [[Agon]], who encouraged her to study to reach her full Drankorian potential. Despite a bit of perhaps excessive Drankorian pride from [[Vola]], the party leaves on good terms.

In the morning, the first stop is [[Seeker]]’s colleague [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]], a Dwarven professor in the Faculty of Metaphysics, a student of the [[Feywild]] and the [[Shadowfell]], but never of experimental metaphysics. From him the party learns that [[Galen]], apparently a bit of a academic rival of [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]]’s, and also apparently a bit full of himself, has gotten a new Dwarven artifact recently, a chalice that he says is connected to other planes. [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]] is up in arms, that a human managed to get this and is meddling with it, when it should be safely observed, and not meddled with, by the [[Dwarves]]. After talking about the [[Feywild]] a bit, promising to bring [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]] back something from the [[Feywild]] should they travel there, speaking with [[Typhina]], and getting a [[The Lore of the Feywild|book]] by [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]] on the [[Feywild]] as reward for a bet [[Seeker]] made, talking about the [[Shadowfell]] and [[Pandemonium]], and asking [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]] to get a book called “Secrets of Reflective Magic: Planar Prisons” from the [[Great Library]] in hopes it will teach them more about how to use the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], the party leaves. 

The next stop is [[The Chapterhouse]], the tavern where [[Dee Wildcloak]] and [[Dain Goldhammer]] frequently take their lunch. From [[Dee Wildcloak]] and [[Dain Goldhammer]] (but really mostly from [[Dee Wildcloak]], who spends most of the story eyeing and flirting with [[Wellby]] and hinting that maybe he should join her when she gets enough funds to start her inn at a crossroads somewhere), they learn the story of their adventures. They left [[Chardon]] with [[Servius]], [[Arcus]], and [[Alban]], all humans. [[Servius]] and [[Arcus]] argued constantly - [[Arcus]] was obsessed with Drankorian artifacts and kept pushing to press ahead, while [[Servius]] kept wanting to chase rumors and find old stories and look in books for clues. [[Alban]], [[Dee Wildcloak]], and [[Dain Goldhammer]] left on the road east of [[Songara]], heading across the plains – passing a giant statue of a Stoneborn warrior that had a [[Stoneborn Statue Dungeon|looted dungeon]] beneath it before coming to [[Stormcaller Tower]]. When they arrived, there were no storms or anything. They began to explore, and when they reached the large carved giant’s head, [[Alban]] told them the [[Hralgar's Eyes|eyes]] and the five [[Binding Stones|gems set into the crown]] were magical, so they took them. That is went things went wrong - lightning came alive on the walls of the tower, and killed [[Alban]], while [[Dee Wildcloak]] and [[Dain Goldhammer]] fled into the growing storm. 

From [[Dee Wildcloak]] and [[Dain Goldhammer]], the party also learns that [[Fausto]] funded their expedition, and probably [[Casian]], [[Kadmos]], and company as well. [[Fausto]] is a very rich scholar – no one knows where his wealth came from, although rumor says he is a retired adventurer. But he likes to spread it around, spend money on expeditions, collect treasures, and trade things around. He will certainly be happy to talk to the party, they say, if they claim to be adventurers looking for work. Indeed, [[Dee Wildcloak]] and [[Dain Goldhammer]] are about to head south, to [[Illoria]], on another mission for [[Fausto]], to aid [[Servius]] who has found rumors of treasure but cannot find adventurers to help him get it. 

The session ends as the party leaves [[The Chapterhouse]], heading to look for [[Gnaeus]], the scholar who wrote the book “[[On the Lost People of the Forests]]” that mentions [[Rai]]. ---

We start as the party makes their way through the [[University of Chardon]] area, to find the scholar [[Gnaeus]], who wrote a book about the people of the [[Elderwood]] that mentioned [[Rai]]. Interrupting his meager class, they buy him lunch and offer a recommendation about his skill, and he tells his story. Although he has been disgraced for using enchantment magic to learn about the Deno’qai in the forest, he claims what he tells is the truth. From [[Gnaeus]], the party learns about the tribes of the Deno’qai, including the [[Baz'aku]], who trade with the Chardonians in the [[Chasa]] River Valley; the reclusive hunters of the [[Bek'eni]], and the [[Te'kula]], who have hidden themselves away to avoid some great evil they will not mention. 

After lunch, the party goes to speak with [[Roscelia]], meeting her for tea at her estate. She introduces them to a friend, [[Lyra]], an archivist at the [[Great Library]], who is interested in stories of adventurers. After introductions and some small talk, they speak about the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]] and the [[Hralgar's Eyes|Giant’s Eyes]], and adventures. [[Roscelia]] and [[Lyra]] are not particularly fond of [[Fausto]], and give the impression that he spends money freely to buy favor and influence. He is, for example, always outbidding the [[Great Library]] to acquire the services of adventurers. [[Lyra]], in particular, is annoyed with him because she sees the [[Society of the Open Scroll]] as an amateur explorer’s club that encourages careless adventuring, not a careful and serious academic endeavor like the [[Great Library]]. But according to [[Lyra]] and [[Roscelia]], probably both [[Galen]], who has the chalice, and [[Fausto]], who has the eyes, can be bargained with. 

The next day, the party splits up for errands: [[Delwath]] sells art and buys supplies for the journey to the [[Elderwood]], and [[Seeker]] returns to Uflgar’s and reads the book about magic mirrors to try to learn more command words for the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]. Everyone meets in the late afternoon for [[Galen]]’s lecture on the wonders of the elemental planes. It an impressive show, mostly of illusion, but also involving the summoning of a real air elemental under [[Galen]]’s control. 

After the show, the party speaks with [[Galen]], who seems disappointed with the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]] – despite a clear connection to the outer planes he cannot get it to do anything. He is willing to part with it for a small premium over what he paid the [[Great Library]] for it, only 10,000 gp, or perhaps a bit less if the party will throw in some small magical trinket of interest. Eventually, they agree to 8,000 gp plus the [[Black Light Candle]] that gives off darkness when burned. [[Riswynn]] will get the money from the [[Dwarves]] in the morning and return to [[Galen]] to finish the deal.

The party also speaks with [[Fausto]] to negotiate for [[Hralgar's Eyes]]. [[Fausto]] initially offers that if they go to [[Illoria]] with [[Dee Wildcloak]] and [[Dain Goldhammer]], and help [[Servius]] in his search for treasure there, he will give them the eyes as part of their payment when they return. Although tempted, the party turns this down, and instead trades information (telling [[Fausto]] about [[Grash]] and the [[Ring of Undying]]) and the [[Pandemonium Scroll]] from the werewolves. 

The next morning, while [[Riswynn]] goes to get money for [[Galen]], the rest of the party goes to meet [[Fausto]] with the [[Pandemonium Scroll]], to trade for the eyes, despite some misgivings and suspicion that it may be a trap. [[Fausto]] is excited to see them, and leads them up a long staircase to a magical workshop. Here, as soon as he gets the scroll, he, of course, turns on the party. Two glass warriors step out of the stained glass windows to attack, and a lightning creature emerges from a bottle on the table. [[Fausto]] disappears, first telling the party that they were foolish to think they could take [[The Cleansed]] by surprise, and that none of them were even pure enough to be worth saving anyway. 

The party decides to flee, smashing through the windows and holding off the glasswork and lightning creatures while everyone dashes out with the eyes, a mace, and the gems from the giant’s crown. While [[Delwath]]’s attempt to banish [[Fausto]] and give them breathing room fails, for a moment it seems like everyone will get out: [[Kenzo]] dashes down the walls of the tower and gracefully glides to the ground; [[Wellby]] uses the [[Raven Whistle]] to fly down; and [[Delwath]] and [[Seeker]] fly using [[Delwath]]’s magic. However, [[Fausto]] reemerges and launches a psychic attack on [[Delwath]] and [[Seeker]], causing [[Delwath]] to lose concentration and both [[Delwath]] and [[Seeker]] to plummet nearly 200 feet to the ground. The impact knocks both unconscious, although the quick application of potions and healing mud brings them back to flee. 

After a desperate dash to the southern edge of the city, as a commotion arises behind them due to [[Fausto]]’s accusations of theft, the party meets [[Riswynn]] near the southern wall. She has been hearing echoes from the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]], and urges everyone to grab it - unfortunately, it is only [[Riswynn]] that is teleported away by the chalice’s magic. As a backup plan, [[Seeker]] teleports to a few hundred feet outside the city with the rest of the party hiding in the [[Portable Hole]], and then polymorphs into a raven to fly further south.

We end as the party catches their breath in a field about ½ mile south of [[Chardon]], hiding by the side of a barn, hoping that no one gave a second thought to the raven that flew here from just outside the gates. ---

## Narrative
The session begins with everybody but [[Kenzo]] meeting for breakfast at [[Ikram’s]] caravanserai. [[Wellby]] shares a message and [[Letter from Candrosa|letter]] from [[Candrosa]], informing the party that scouts are investigating rumors of attacks to the south and east, and that a council in a few days time will meet to decide what to do. The presence of the Heroes of [[Karawa]] is requested at this council. After being informed that [[Kenzo]] is meditating at the summit of the [[Red Mesa]] on the southern border of town, the party heads up to meet him; on the way [[Seeker]] is reminded of the geological oddity that the [[Temple of Shakun]], carved into the cliff wall of the mesa, seems to be older than the mesa itself. 

Here, some discussion ensues of various pre-dawn encounters. [[Kenzo]] tells the party about [[Dreamweaver Staff|Candrosa's staff]], which sent him to a starry void filled with flickering lights of all colors and shapes (reminding [[Seeker]] of his coming of age vision), and then to the [[Dreamworld]], a mirror realm that is like and very unlike Taelgar. Here, he saw a robed man with a staff, who told him to seek the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]]. While no one in the party knows much about this order, there are legends of mystics that roam the desert and go by this name. After some discussion of magic, planes, and the gods, [[Wellby]] begins to tell his story.

During the night, he learned more about [[Ander Charmheart|Ander]], the sick halfling who the party met the day before, from his sister [[Callie Charmheart|Callie]]. The halfling caravan came south from [[Sembara|Sembara]] through the mountains, passing an abandoned old Dunmari fortress and stronghold known as [[Raven's Hold]]. [[Ander Charmheart|Ander]] went exploring, finding a way past the walls. Beyond the wall he was exploring when he heard a chanting in a strange language, and a thorny vine reached out to grab him. He was able to break free, but the vine grabbed him and bloodied his leg. Within a few days, he was starting to change, he was either consumed by ravenous hunger for raw flesh or raving about the coming master who would consume the world. 

That afternoon, the party goes back to [[Jasu]]’s workshop to see the silver spearpoints he described the day before. These are clearly magical, and decorated with designs that suggest some power against undead. [[Jasu]] also says that [[Arcus]] was expected back several weeks ago, and he was surprised and annoyed he did not return. [[Seeker]] shows [[Jasu]] his design for a lightweight chain throwing net. Even though [[Jasu]] was left unpaid by [[Arcus]], he agrees to cash on delivery for this new commission.

Over the next few days, a few things happen. The gifts from the grateful town accumulate for the party, including a book dropped off by an anonymous donor for [[Seeker]] entitled “[[The Runes of Creation]].” [[Delwath]] spends some time listening for rumors, [[Seeker]] studies his new book, [[Kenzo]] competes in the staff dancing competition, and [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] both compete in the axebeak riding competition. 

Before the competitions begin, [[Delwath]] hears a number of rumors. Right now the town seems mostly happy, the dire news of attacks to the south having not yet reached the ears of anyone but [[Candrosa]] and the village elders. A joyful mood at the festival and being saved from the rampaging beasts permeates [[Delwath]]’s conversations, although with an undercurrent of sadness for the lives lost. [[Delwath]] learns that [[Arcus]] was only in town for a few days and didn’t leave much of an impression, but he was not the first traveler from foreign parts to pass through town in the past few months. Most of the rumors involve ruins and artifacts: the name [[Raven's Hold]] is mentioned, as is the claim that the [[Temple of Shakun]] has a number of ancient artifacts, and the angry fear that [[Chardon]] is trying to steal [[Dunmar]]’s heritage. Some people are also concerned though: the rumors of a storm that won’t end to the north arises again, and some people feel that the gods must have abandoned [[Karawa]] for these events to be happening. 

The staff dancing competition involves a bout with a quarterstaff on a balance beam: the first contestant to fall off loses. As rumors of [[Kenzo]]’s prowess have spread, he competes in the master’s division. [[Kenzo]] puts on an incredible performance, drawing a large crowd and defeating his quarterfinal and semifinal matches with ease. For the finals, he faces off against [[Jayden]], a blindingly fast woman who makes up for her lack of expertise with the quarterstaff with raw speed and balance. In a masterful display of skill and raw agility, [[Kenzo]] ducks, dodges, and knocks her off the balance beam. [[Seeker]] is inspired to create a series of drawings depicting individual moments in the action. He combines these drawings into a sequence, entitling it “The Legendary Staff of [[Kenzo]].” He names this new art form the “graphic novel.” 

The axebeak riding competition draws some of the biggest crowds of the festival. The race works by just marking how far down the course each person gets before falling off. [[Wellby]] attempts to feed his beast, but the creature takes a giant bite out of his hand and goes charging down the course. Despite bleeding from his hand, Welby manages to keep control over his beast for a long way, ending up nearly the furthest down the track, and eventually finishes third. [[Kenzo]] however does not do so well, falling well short of the lead.

The morning of April 4th, [[Alesh]] and [[Havdar]] are back from scouting and the council begins. In addition to the party, the council includes [[Alesh]], [[Havdar]], [[Suma]] (priestess of [[Jeevali]]), [[Candrosa]], and Elder [[Kisa]] (unofficial mayor/leader of the town). After much discussion and news, [[Havdar]] proposes an immediate counter-offensive to defeat the bands of hyena-like humanoids attacking to the south; [[Alesh]] proposes sending a messenger to Samraat [[Nayan Karnas]], the current king of [[Dunmar]]; [[Candrosa]] and [[Kisa]] believe the town must be fortified for defense; and [[Suma]] proposing fleeing west to [[Tokra]], to a more defensible position that is less isolated and alone. With no consensus, the council turns to the party for input. [[Seeker]] annotates a large paper map of the area, and conjures glowing illusory figures moving around above it, representing the various options for movement of troops and townspeople. After much debate, it is decided that the vast majority of the Dunmari (and festival visitors) will flee west, with [[Havdar]] and his troops (plus whomever he can recruit among the festival population of the town) providing a rear-guard defense for this retreat. [[Candrosa]] and a few other acolytes of [[Shakun]], who will not abandon their temple, will fortify themselves inside the temple and hope to hide from any attack. [[Alesh]] and a few companions will scout again to the south, trying to learn more about the threat there. An emissary will be found to ride to the king with all speed, and argue for a muster and a defense of the border. And the party will head north, to [[Raven's Hold]], to seek what information may lie there.

We start as the party takes a brief breather in the shadow of a barn in a field of wheat, about a half-mile south of [[Chardon]], having just fled from [[Fausto]]. During the course of a tense day, [[Wellby]] sneaks upriver and finds a place where the party can sleep, unmolested. The next morning, as dawn comes, the party discusses the situation and decides to ride as fast as possible east, with one person riding at a time while the rest of the party remains in the mirror. While [[Wellby]] heads to the nearby market town to buy horses, [[Delwath]] attempts to scry, first on [[Marcella]] (which fails), and then on [[Fausto]] (which succeeds). [[Fausto]] is finishing breakfast, an invisible servant carrying his dishes away, and then takes out a silver mirror with an elaborate jeweled border decoration, and begins casting scrying. 

The rest of the day and into the night, [[Wellby]] rides hard, changing horses frequently. He passes the wine town of [[Metium]] around 3 pm, before running out of steam around midnight about 85 miles east of [[Chardon]]. The next morning, get an early start in the pre-dawn light and ride all day, making another 60 miles with the horses tiring around 9 pm. Pass a tall gray standing monolith stone around 130 miles east of [[Chardon]]. May possibly be associated with the fey, somehow; later learn that this is one of several treaty stones marking the agreements between humans and [[Elves|elves]] in these lands, thousands of years ago. Camp at 9 pm, and rest.

The next day proceeds similarly, pushing 45 miles before one of the horses pulls a muscle and cannot continue. [[Wellby]] gives him away to an apricot farmer named Marcus, and then finds a place to camp near the city of [[Erlona]], a substantial city with a large coliseum. Near the city, [[Wellby]] also passes an army of perhaps 500 Chardonian soldiers setting camp on their way east. The night’s sleep is interrupted by nightmares: a shadow creature with a long spear wrapped in darkness and a red and black mask appears, saying that he is coming for them.

However, the horses get their rest, and the next morning the party decides it is time for fresh horses, so [[Wellby]] spends the day going into [[Erlona]] to buy new horses and sell the old. He also maintains the cover story that he has made it to his caravan. The rest of the day, [[Kenzo]] takes over, with everyone else in the mirror, making it another 60 miles before calling it a night. 

That night, while the party tries to rest, a pack of shadow dogs attacks, seemingly attempting to get away with blood from party members. However, they are all killed, despite the heroic [[Ladder]] running away in fear. Trying to rest after the battle, [[Seeker]] is again beset by nightmares, this time of the shadow dogs hunting him and tearing him to pieces, and does not get a rest. 

The next day, the party sets out again, with [[Kenzo]] on the horses, but he is unable to keep up the pace [[Wellby]] was able to set before. After traveling about 30 miles, the horses tired from being frightened of the shadow dogs, the party takes a rest, and [[Wellby]] takes over again. After traveling another 20 miles, the horses are exhausted and the party camps. 

During the journey, [[Delwath]] also spends time Scrying, and sees [[Marcella]] and [[Sura]]. [[Marcella]] is in the mountains to the east, sleeping. [[Sura]] is praying in her tent, reading a prayer book waiting for someone, and then a messenger arrives. He says he has ridden all the way to [[Tokra]], and no one there knew the secret of unpetrifying a person. [[Govir]], at the [[Archives]], is doing some research to see what he can learn, but no one knows how the sword caused this. 

Trying to sleep, [[Seeker]] again has nightmares, of the shadow hunter catching up to him and saying “I found you!”. The rest of the party is watching in the dream mirror, and immediately tries to wake [[Seeker]], as the sound of howls echoes in from near the camp, and the session ends.

We start in combat, with the party fighting the shadow hunter and his shadow dogs. [[Seeker]], mostly drained of spells, turns into a Huge Giant Crab for the fight, which sadly does not last long. While [[Wellby]] deals with the dogs, and [[Kenzo]] flees due to the magical fear effect, the shadow hunter knocks [[Seeker]] unconscious and begins to flee with him, until saved by [[Delwath]] and banishing smite. 

After the battle, the party watches as the mask falls off the face of the shadow hunter, and in death he shifts to a normal human, looking pale and gaunt. As he dies, he warns or threatens the party that there are many more chalyte zombies in [[Chardon]] and it will not take long for [[Fausto]] to make more hunters. Before sleeping, the party looks at the mask in [[The Mirror of the Past]], seeing a [[Shadow Hunter's Mask Vision|vision of its past]].

Over the next two days, the party makes their way to [[Arendum]], arriving late at night and taking rooms at the [[Laughing Wolf Inn]], outside the gates. The next day – the first of September – the party spends in [[Arendum]], getting information and planting rumors, and sending letters back to the people they met in [[Chardon]], warning them of [[Fausto]]. From their time in [[Arendum]], they get the sense there is tension between the Chardonians and the Deno’qai: there are no Deno’qai in the town, and it feels like the town is organized around defense. [[Delwath]] buys supplies for a journey north, and spreads rumors about heading to the [[Dwarves]] and then over the mountains to [[Sembara|Sembara]].

The next day, the party heads north, before turning east and south at the confluence with the [[Kayan]] river, turning invisible as they depart the [[Chasa]]. For the next two days, the party travels along the [[Kayan]], invisible, passing pastures and dairy farmers, the occasional forester, and a Chardonian patrol returning from the eave of the woods. Traveling slowly to maintain invisibility during daylight, it takes two days to get into the depths of the [[Elderwood]]. 

By September 4th, the party is deep in the woods, following the [[Kayan]] river under the eaves of the giant redwoods of the forest. Around mid-morning, [[Kenzo]] begins straying from the path along the river, his staff seeming to lead him deeper into the woods. Deciding to follow, the party arrives as a massive clearing, at least 400 feet across. In the center stands a huge tree, towering over the forest itself, stretching maybe 400 feet into the sky, with a 50 foot diameter trunk. [[Kenzo]], drawn to the tree, goes into a trance, becoming one with the forest itself, feeling his perception extend and merge with the network of trees, experiencing the forest as a web of relationships between ancient entities. As [[Kenzo]] goes deeper in this trance, he touches something sour, an acidic corruption covered by a sickly sweet taste. Trying to probe deeper into the corruption, [[Kenzo]] is ejected from his trance, dazed. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the party has encountered a patrol from a Deno’qai village, led by [[Zevi of the Bek'eni]], a warrior from the [[Bek'eni]] tribe. He questions why they are in the [[Bek'eni]] forest, wonders at the behavior of [[Kenzo]], and asks the party to come with his band of warriors to their village, to meet [[Mezzar]], an [[Elves]] who has been advising and aiding the [[Bek'eni]] for the past 10 years. The party agrees to go, helps [[Kenzo]] stand and walk, and heads 5 miles east with the [[Bek'eni]].

Arriving at the village, the party meets [[Zaro]], the chief of the village, and [[Itar]], the Godcaller. [[Delwath]] is treated like a lord, offered a place of honor at dinner, while the rest of the party is relegated to meager accommodations. [[Zaro]] and especially [[Itar]] talk a lot about [[Mezzar]], saying he is expected in the next couple of days and he will be eager to meet [[Delwath]]. [[Itar]] knows little about the tanshi, but is eager to talk about [[Elves|elves]] and [[Mezzar]], and dresses in an imitation of the elven style. The party learns that [[Mezzar]] is trying to deal with the corruption of the [[Te'kula]], and has been taking villagers from the [[Bek'eni]] and training them for this purpose. The party goes to sleep, a little suspicious of [[Mezzar]] but also eager to meet another [[Elves]], especially [[Delwath]]. 

The next morning, while [[Kenzo]] is discussing his experience with the God tree (having been incoherent the day before), [[Wellby]] catches a woman, apparently not well-treated by the tribe, listening in. She introduces herself as [[Theba]], the former Godcaller, ousted by [[Mezzar]]. She tries to convince the party to help her recover her magic gear, taken by [[Mezzar]] (who claimed it belonged to the tribe, not her), and then flee with her to investigate what is really going on with the [[Te'kula]] (she offers to guide the party if they help her recover her stuff). [[Theba]] tells them of another [[Elves]], [[Belegor]], who stayed for a while and then vanished after speaking with [[Mezzar]], and does not want the party to suffer that fate. 

Suspicious but not swayed, the party goes to the God tree. [[Delwath]] scries [[Belegor]] from a drawing [[Seeker]] makes based on [[Theba]]’s description, but the scry fails. [[Kenzo]] communes more with the God tree, reaching out and feeling two [[Elves|elves]] in the forest (one here, one to the south), which the party assumes are [[Mezzar]] and [[Delwath]], despite learning that [[Mezzar]] is supposed to come from the East. 

After returning to the [[Bek'eni]] village, the party debates what to do. Still uncertain, they decide to at least get [[Theba]]’s gear for her. Clairvoyance reveals the layout of the house, and a basement with a small treasure pile (including [[Theba]]’s gear), plus two things that look like patrolling clouds of poisonous gas. [[Delwath]] scouts and encounters large poisonous snakes hiding in the trees, and learns the two statues by the front door are magic and probably trapped. [[Seeker]] and [[Delwath]] dimension door into the stairs to the basement, where [[Delwath]] dashes to grab [[Theba]]’s gear (taking an attack from the poison cloud), and then both [[Seeker]] and [[Delwath]] flee with teleportation magic. 

That night, the party decides in the morning they will meet [[Mezzar]] by the God tree, but be ready for a fight. The next morning, the chief [[Zaro]] is reluctant to let them leave for the God tree until [[Seeker]] uses Suggestion on him. The party then proceeds to the God tree to wait for [[Mezzar]]. ---

We begin as the party waits at the God tree for the [[Elves|elf]] [[Mezzar]], debating whether to wait or to flee. While doing so, they look at the God tree in [[The Mirror of the Past]], seeing [[God Tree Vision|a vision]].

The party then sets an ambush: [[Wellby]] is hiding behind a minor illusion of a coil of rope on a wooden platform suspended 30 feet above the ground, while [[Kenzo]] waits about 100 feet up in the lower branches of the God tree. [[Mezzar]] arrives, introduces himself, and attempts to cast Suggestion to first get [[Seeker]], and then [[Delwath]] (twice) to step away with him and have a conversation privately for a few minutes. The spells fail, and [[Wellby]], seeing the third attempt, shoots an arrow as combat breaks out. The combat is initially going well for the party, as [[Seeker]] turns into a Huge Giant Crab and [[Mezzar]]’s attempt to dominate the beast fails. But as the spell fails, [[Mezzar]] shifts form, turning from an [[Elves|elf]] to an adult green dragon, and takes to the air. After a blast of poison gas from his breath weapon catches all of the party and kills every Deno’qai who came with [[Mezzar]] from the village, things look rough and the party decides to flee. The heroic rope [[Ladder]] remains behind, tangling with the dragon, sacrificing itself so the party can escape. 

After the [[Dragons|dragon]] leaves to go back to the village, the party takes the time to bury the dead, leave a letter explaining what has happened, and construct a crude stone monument with Wall of Stone, before leaving for the clearing to the south where [[Theba]] said she would meet them the following day. 

[[Theba]] arrives early the next morning, after [[Delwath]] has spent the pre-dawn and early morning hours scrying, learning that the [[Bek'eni]] are out hunting for the party (presumably), and the letter they left describing what happened has been torn up. [[Theba]] leads the party quickly through the forest to the [[Te'kula]] territory, covering the 110 mile journey in a little more than 3 days, thanks to [[Theba]]’s guidance. 

On the afternoon of September 10th, the party arrives at the boundary of the [[Te'kula]] village, which has been shifting into a pocket dimension. [[Theba]] warns the party not to leave the path, which twists and turns through dense forest. Despite seeing scenes of fears (whether actually occurring or imagined) and other images, the party enters the village of the [[Te'kula]]. 

In the village they are greeted by [[Yota]], the chief of the village, and [[Alayah]], the young Godcaller. [[Alayah]] has been expecting the party, having dreamed of [[Kenzo]] before. When the party meets, [[Alayah]]’s [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]] and [[Kenzo]]’s [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]] are drawn together, and they tentatively let them touch, transporting [[Alayah]] and [[Kenzo]] into a [[First Dream of Rai|dream]]. 

After the vision, the party has dinner with the village. From [[Alayah]], they learn the story of the [[Te'kula]]. Thirty years ago, [[Jordo]] found the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]] embedded in a fallen God tree, and took it, starting to have dreams of [[Rai]]. When [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]] came asking to trade for the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]], he refused, defiantly, and for his refusal the village was attacked. Many died, but in desperation [[Jordo]] called out to the tanshi, and miraculously the [[Te'kula]] were sheltered in a pocket dimension.

Later, [[Delwath]] and the [[Elves]] [[Belegor]] have a chance to speak. He talks of what happened to the [[Elves|elves]]: many were killed in the battles against [[Cha'mutte]]’s lieutenants during the [[Great War]], and many of the survivors turned inward, to isolationist, hiding their settlements away in secret places, or even in the [[Feywild]]. However, many [[Elves|elves]] also vanished, and [[Belegor]] does not know exactly where they went. Some think they were pulled away to other planes, as [[Cha'mutte]] died and his attempted unraveling of the separation of the planes failed. Others think they left to fight evil across the dimensions, or they fled, teleporting whole cities to other planes. 

[[Belegor]] returned from the wars to have children, but did not want to stay hidden forever, so when his children were grown old enough to join their generation-mates he left the hidden town of their birth to wander. He found the Deno’qai, and spent some time with the [[Bek'eni]], but when he met [[Mezzar]], he was suspicious. [[Mezzar]] attempted to geas him, and when he resisted, turned to a dragon and drove him off. He found the [[Te'kula]], and has been hiding here ever since. 

That night, [[Delwath]] prays to [[Yezali|Aaviskar]], and understands the truth of the dimension that protects the [[Te'kula]]. The tanshi do not normally have power to influence the material world so directly, but through the power of the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]], which formed a hole through which the [[tanshi]] could act, [[Aasimti]], the spirit of the forest leaves and dappled shadows, managed to create a pocket dimension that could not be accessed without their consent. 

That night, [[Kenzo]] and [[Alayah]] also [[Second Dream of Rai|dream]] together. 

The next morning, [[Delwath]] speaks with the old woman [[Ariel]], who remembers the lost tanshi and tells him they can be found in the [[Forest of Dreams]], to the north. Then [[Theba]] approaches, telling the party she has been praying all night and decided they must fight the dragon. 

War planning then commences, with [[Theba]] and the [[tanshi]] offering blessings to help, and [[Obel]], an old ranger whose parents and brother were killed by the original attack volunteering to join as well. 

The next morning, on Sept 12th, the party leaves for [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]’s lair, traveling with the guidance of [[Obel]], [[Theba]], and the [[tanshi]] for the next three days, arriving at the lair on September 15th. The forest is warm, almost tropical, dense and close here, the tang of saccharine sweetness in the air covering the rot, the only animals snakes that stare at the party as they pass. The lair itself is a cave underground, in the rotted out root complex of a God tree. A massive banyan tree grows around where the trunk of the God tree once was, forming a tunnel the dragon can fly out of. Shafts in the earth provide light and ventilation for the cave below. 

The party prepares for the fight, and enters the lair both above and from the main entrance. Although the dragon is waiting for them, and has four snake-person minions with him, careful planning helps ensure the battle goes well for the party. A well-placed Wall of Stone traps the snake minions, and the metal anchor chain animated by [[Seeker]] manages to grapple the dragon, keeping it pinned to the ground for a few rounds, until it is also destroyed. [[Delwath]], [[Theba]], and [[Kenzo]] fly around the dragon, getting consistent solid hits despite its high Constitution making stun almost impossible to pull off, and [[Wellby]] is able to pincushion it with arrows. Finally, [[Kenzo]] manages to bring the dragon down with a massive magical punch, and it comes crashing down on its hoard. 

After a breather, the party spends the next day gathering [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]'s treasure joard, with many thousands of coins, plentiful gems, and beautiful objects of art and magical items. Spending three days to return to the [[Te'kula]], the party then enjoys some well deserved rest and downtime to train, while the treasure is gathered and divided up, and the bodies of the Deno’qai transformed by [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]] are collected and given a proper burial. Messengers go out to the other tribes, and [[Theba]] organizes a diplomatic mission to break the news of [[Mezzar]]’s deception and the other corrupting influences the [[Dragons|dragon]] had on the forest. [[Kenzo]] speaks with [[Alayah]], who turns over her [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]] to him at the fallen God tree, where he also takes some wood to carve into figurines to give to people whose stories he collects. 

During this time, the party also looks at two items in the [[The Mirror of the Past|mirror of Eudomes]], seeing the [[Mace of Terror Vision]] and the [[Hralgar's Eyes Vision]].

Finally, on September 30th, the party leaves, with [[Theba]], a diplomatic mission, and the [[Elves]] [[Belegor]], to go to visit the rest of the Deno’qai tribes. As [[Kenzo]] leaves the pocket dimension with both jades, the portal allowing the [[tanshi]] to reach the world disappears, and the [[Te'kula]] territory returns to the material plane. 

As the pocket dimension closes, the party is caught in the backlash. For a moment, briefly, they can see each other being pulled in different directions: [[Wellby]], to a ship approaching the jagged coastline of an island far across [[Green Sea]]; [[Delwath]], to a campfire hidden in the [[Forest of Dreams]]; [[Seeker]], to a meadow of butterflies with two satyrs frolicking across it; [[Kenzo]], to a dense, tropical forest, the wooden paths of a [[lizardfolk]] village just visible amongst the greenery. In this moment, you realize what is happening and you all think to each other, find a way to the [[Feywild]], to the portal near [[Stormcaller Tower]], we will meet again there. And then, you are falling. ---

## Narrative

We begin as [[Delwath]] arrives in the vast northern forests, in the late afternoon, the only sign of civilization a campfire in the distance. Approaching the campfire, [[Delwath]] sees a hunting camp of maybe a dozen Deno'qai, surprised and awed to see an [[Elves]] speaking their tongue. The leader of the hunting band introduces himself as [[Kaslan]], and he speaks with [[Delwath]] briefly about the lost tanshi, the Meswati, when [[Delwath]] says he is here to find them. 

[[Kaslan]] insists [[Delwath]] come to the [[Ko'zula]] village and speak with [[Ninu]], the chief. Spending the night in camp, [[Delwath]] hears something of how the [[Ko'zula#History|Ko'zula surived the Great War]]. A young boy, [[Zevi of the Ko'zula|Zevi]], is assigned to guide him the next morning, and they arrive a few days later. 

In the village, [[Delwath]] is welcomed with a feast, and meets [[Ninu]]. From her, he learns stories of the Meswati. To begin her tale, she brings out two fragments of broken armbands, melted and split, which [[Delwath]] recognizes immediately, for one is identical to the armband he touched before being teleported to the shadow realm. It has been in the village for many years, and no one thought anything of it. Last year, a deathless warlock wearing the second armband emerged from the [[Forest of Nightmares]] and attacked the village. A warrior from the village, [[Jotha]] was gravely wounded near death, and grasped the deathless creature to hold it to the ground for her companions to butcher, but as she touched the armband she vanished. [[Iascaire]], a druid skilled in the manipulation of fire, destroyed both, hoping it would do something, but nothing happened. 

This was the exact moment that [[Delwath]] fell from the sky outside [[Kharsan]].

As [[Delwath]] mentions this, [[Ninu]] tells [[Delwath]] that the Deno'qai have long though the Meswati were trapped, somehow, by the evil magic of [[Cha'mutte]], for most believe that cannot truly be killed as long as they are not forgotten. [[Delwath]] suggests that it is likely these armbands that have trapped the Meswati, for one, [[Yezali]], was trapped with him. Destroying the armbands that captured each tanshi, then, may be the key to freeing them. 

Asking where the other armbands may be found, [[Ninu]] tells [[Delwath]] that a stoneborn, [[Aristaea]], knows the [[Forest of Nightmares]] well, and is at a hunting camp with [[Iascaire]], the druid. [[Ninu]] suggests they would help [[Delwath]] with his quest. 

Deciding to head to the hunting camp, [[Delwath]] first meets with [[Enon]], the Godcaller of the [[Ko'zula]], who gifts him a [[Deno'qai Lynx Shield|shield]] and [[Deno'qai Scale Mail|armor]] carried by [[Balati]], a Deno'qai hero of the [[Great War]], to aid him on his quest. ---

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1748-10-06):  Arrive at the hunting camp, meet [[Aristaea]] Mountainhands and [[Iascaire]]
- (DR:: 1748-10-07):  Set up from camp with [[Aristaea]] and [[Iascaire]] for the [[Forest of Nightmares]]. Arrive at the battlefield of the Battle without Hope. Fight haunted spirits, uncover the location of a shadow armband, destroy it, freeing [[Yalik'i]] and [[Nisir]]. Depart late afternoon, walk through the night.
- (DR:: 1748-10-08):  Arrive at the site of the Battle of Darkfire in the mid-morning. Remove the armband from the dead body of a massive demon while fighting demonic beasts and trees. Destroy armband, freeing [[Yezali]]. Head back to safety of [[Ko'zula]] land to rest.

## Narrative

We begin in the hunting camp, where [[Delwath]] meets [[Aristaea]] and [[Iascaire]], and they discuss the battlefields of the [[Forest of Nightmares]]: the Battle of Darkfire, where [[Yezali]] fell; the Battle of Ye'mote, where [[Midri]] and [[K'onisati]] fell; the Battle of Endless Dark, where [[Taraka]] fell; and the Battle without Hope, where [[Yalik'i]] and [[Nisir]] fell. 

After looking at some maps and discussing routes, the group decides to head for the Battle without Hope first. Traveling through the [[Forest of Nightmares]] is eerie, for there is almost no sound, no animals, just the occasional creak of the trees in the wind and the whisper of ghosts in the distance, the occasional hint out of the corner of your eye that something is moving in the distance. 

The battlefield on which the Battle without Hope was fought is now a deserted, abandoned Deno'qai village, a small collection of huts in a clearing in the woods. But there are odd signs of a simlacrum of life: clothes still on a line, rotting away but neatly hung, a fire pit where bones have been piled but there is no fuel or meat to cook. 

In the village, the party encounters flashbacks of the past, of the battle that happened here. [[Aristaea]] sees the central green filled with warriors prepared for battle, when hundreds and hundreds of [[Hobgoblins]] accompanied by flying demons emerge from shadow portals and attack. An air of malaise hangs over the village and infects the warriors, for they don't attack, just stand waiting to be slaughtered. The only one who reacts is the priest, who shapeshifts into a giant bird to battle the hobgoblin commander, who is wearing one of [[Cha'mutte’s Shadow Armband|Cha'mutte's Shadow Armbands]]. 

The vision fades as the rest of the party fights a shadow creature with long spikes for arms. As the shadow creature is killed, and the party continues to explore, another vision, this time experienced by [[Delwath]]. The battle continuing, the tanshi bolstering the Godcaller, fighting across the village square with the hobgoblin commander. 

This continues, exploring the village and fighting with nightmare visions of the past, while the occasional creature of sorrow and despair attacks, and eventually the party pieces together the scene of battle, that the Godcaller fought the commander to a standstill, but the hobgoblin wizard spoke a word and struck him dead. As the Godcaller falls, two spirits -- tanshi -- attack the wizard, striking him down, but vanishing as they struggle to remove the armband from the hobgoblin's dead body. Identifying the location where the wizard fell, the party digs up his dead body after killing more of the sorrow creatures, and destroys the armband with [[Iascaire]]'s fire magic, freeing [[Yalik'i]] and[[Nisir]]

After a short rest, the party then heads to the Battle of Darkfire. Approaching the battlefield, the party sees the vast body of a dead demon lying a clearing, [[Cha'mutte’s Shadow Armband]] around his wrist. Beginning to approach, the trees and beasts of the forest, flush with demonic energy, attack. The trees are vulnerable to [[Iascaire]]'s fire, and [[Delwath]] uses the magic of [[Narengril]] to create a magic circle impenetrable by demons. Still, the battle is difficult, as the armband cannot be harmed by fire while on the demon's wrist. Eventually, [[Delwath]]'s shadow beast severs the armband from the demon's wrist, and [[Iascaire]] is able to destroy the armband with fire before the party is overwhelmed, freeing [[Yezali]]. 

We end the session as the party retreats to rest in the safety of the [[Ko'zula]] forests.

## Narrative

We begin as the party returns to the [[Forest of Nightmares]], heading for the Battle of Endless Dark. Approaching the battlefield, the party finds a maze of trees and thickets, completely in magical darkness. At the center of the maze, the party finds a skeleton of a giant, a portal to a shadow realm, and the ghost of the giant. He calls himself [[Zegron]], and he is hoping the party is here to punish those who fled, cowardly, from their duty in battle. Apparently this giant was in [[Cha'mutte]]'s army, and is angry with the [[Hobgoblins]] still hiding in the shadow realm, who would not fight. 

The party agrees to go into the shadow realm to fight the [[Hobgoblins]], hoping perhaps to free [[Taraka]] as well. Emerging into a flat, featureless plain of shadow, the party sees a small group of [[Hobgoblins]] who seem to be watching the portal, and in the distance, a much larger army that seems to be constantly chasing campfires that blink in and out in the darkness. The party struggles to defeat the organized hobgoblin attack, led by a wizard, low on spells but still dangerous, flying above the battlefield. Nonetheless eventually the [[Hobgoblins]] are killed. The wizard commander is missing an arm, and with it the [[Cha'mutte’s Shadow Armband]] he carried, presuambly. 

Exiting the portal, the party speaks with [[Zegron]], who thanks them for dealing with the traitors, and indicates where to dig to find the wizard's arm as he vanishes. Digging up the arm, the party is faced with a dilemma. Destroying the armband would free [[Taraka]], but also the large hobgoblin army trapped with them. Eventually, they devise a plan to send in [[Delwath]] to attempt to banish both [[Taraka]] and himself back to the material plane, leaving the [[Hobgoblins]] trapped, and then close the portal here by attuning to the armband. Amazingly, the plan works, and both [[Taraka]] and [[Delwath]] make it back.

After a brief rest, the group then heads for the final battlefield, the Battle of Ye'mote. The battlefield is on the banks of the [[Yemo'te]] river. A broken bridge crosses the river, and forest is littered with signs of an ancient battlefield: small mounds where the plants have grown over dead bodies, bits of rusting armor and weapons sticking from the ground, white filaments of fungus wrapping many of the bodies in cocoons. 

Across the river the party can see the rotted body of a hobgoblin warlock, with a shadow armband. As they move to approach, hoards of undead attack. The relentless swarms of undead fall easily in battle, but they seem to be endless, until [[Aristaea]] strikes the warlock down with a critical strike of divine energy. As the undead fall away, [[Iascaire]] destroys the last armband, freeing [[Midri]] and [[K'onisati]]. 

We end as the party returns to the [[Ko'zula]] village to celebrate, and [[Delwath]] bids farewell to [[Iascaire]] and [[Aristaea]].

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1748-08-24): Vanish from [[Chardon]] after using the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]]; appear in [[Heart of the Mountain]]; speak with the [[Bahrazel]]; rest.
- (DR:: 1748-08-25), morning: Venture into the realm of [[Morkalan]]
## Narrative

We begin in a vast cavern with a still pool in the center, a place in [[Heart of the Mountain]], the realm of the [[Bahrazel]], the dwarven gods. [[Riswynn]], [[Rothfis]], [[Merash]], and [[Thror]] find themselves transported here. In [[Riswynn]]'s case, by the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]]; in everyone else's, by divine magic, and not necessarily by choice. 

As the sound of hammers banging against anvils and the smell of iron permeates the chamber, the party feels they are in the presence of the gods. All, but [[Riswynn]], owing a debt, which the [[Bahrazel]] now claim, a physical token of this debt appearing out of the water in the pool. To redeem their debts to the [[Bahrazel]], the party is to travel to the [[Shadowfell]] domain of [[Morkalan]], where they will find the dwarf [[Hagrim]], whose evil deeds created the place, and either send him to damnation or atonement with the power of the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]]. 

As the party rests before preparing to depart, they see scenes of the history of the Chalice of the Runepriest:

- The chalice started as a mark of safety, a place of refuge from war in the new kingdom of [[Nardith]]. It was taken north, later, by a group of soldiers, traveling to find refugees, gathering lists of names of those who were lost in the [[Great War]], with the hope the chalice can help lead them to safety. 
- In the north, these warriors found success, finding hundreds upon hundreds of refugees, hiding in the dark. On the way back, the long march across the plains, they are sustained by the chalice. 
- Until a fire giant, [[Odim Mavdyrson]], attacked the refugees, screaming about vengeance for his father, trolls with him. 
- The refugees flee with the chalice, to a massive Stoneborn statue on the plains. They build hasty fortifications, a grim warrior bearing a large two-handed axe and an iron helm leading the way. Carrying the chalice. 
- Then flames flickering at the end of the fight. The grim warrior turning on his companions, dwarf fighting dwarf, the warrior screaming that death is all that is left. The chalice, lying forgotten. The smoke gradually growing thicker and thicker as the grim warrior, the refugees, the trolls, all flicker out one by one and vanish. The chalice left, abandoned.

The party steps through the waters of the pool, with the chalice, and arrives in [[Morkalan]], a land of dim light, constantly cloudy skies, a slow muddy river, and a pervasive grayness, seemingly a distorted echo of the land around the Stoneborn statue from the vision of the chalice' history. The party heads for lights that seem to mark a settlement at the base of a series of cliffs along the left bank of the river. 

![[rmorkalan-muddy-river.png|500]]

Approaching the village, [[Riswynn]] and [[Merash]] approach the dull-looking [[Dwarves]] on patrol. One leaves, apparently to alert [[Morkalan]] of newcomers, and the other carries out halting conversation. He seems almost robotic, patrolling because it is what soldiers do, and [[Morkalan]] insists, but he does not stop the party from proceeding to the small village nestled in the base of the cliffs.

The village of [[Bleakhold]] is unnaturally quiet, despite smalls signs of life, and there is little sign of people. The party fails to convince an older woman dwarf to speak with them, but does find a smith who opens his door to them. His name is [[Dworic]], and he is surprised by newcomers, but tells the party that [[Morkalan]] is always watching, testing their loyalty; that the people on the top of the cliffs are human; that somewhere out in the wastes with the trolls, where the disloyal are sent, is the Mad Priest, who talks of other [[Dwarves]] as if [[Morkalan]] is not all there is in the universe. [[Dworic]] also tells them of a boy, [[Tak]], who also believes there are other [[Dwarves]] out there, but who is missing. He lives next door with his father. 

The party goes to speak with [[Tak]]'s father, [[Rurik]], and after come convincing and bribery with [[Rothfis]]' bread, cheese, and ale from his tavern, they learn that [[Tak]] wanders off, looking for the ghosts to talk to (especially his mother), and speaking of other [[Dwarves]]. He usually comes back, but this time he has been gone for too long. Taking some crude, homemade clay soldiers that [[Tak]] liked to play with as a young boy to remind him of his father, the party leaves to search for [[Tak]].

After traveling along the muddy river, and climbing the cliff, they find him, hiding in a cave and being attacked wight-like [[Dwarves]]. The party moves quickly to deal with the undead, and while some of them turn out to have magic, the lightning bolts of [[Thror]], the quick fists of [[Rothfis]], [[Merash]] exploding maul, and [[Riswynn]]'s hammer [[Shatterstorm]] defeat the undead. 

With the undead defeated, the party rescues [[Tak]], who leads them to the ghost of [[Nora Silverspark]], where we end the session. ---

- (DR:: 1748-10-27) - (DR_end:: 1748-11-01): Kenzo waits in [[Bedez]] for other lizardfolk to gather
## Narrative

We begin as [[Kenzo]] lands in a lush tropical jungle, on the dimly lit forest floor, among the think trunks and roots of the massive trees that make the canopy far above, surrounded by the vibrant sounds of life. [[Kenzo]]’s contemplation is quickly broken by a scream, a cry of distress from nearby. Rushing to investigate, [[Kenzo]] finds a lizardfolk man being attacked by two dinosaurs with corrupted auras. Quickly driving them off, the man introduces himself as [[Elazar]], and tells [[Kenzo]] a bit of where his is: very far away, far to the east and south, in the lizardfolk Kingdom of [[Orekatu]]. 

As [[Kenzo]] and [[Elazar]] return to the village of [[Bedez]], [[Elazar]] tells [[Kenzo]] a little bit about what has been happening: there is something that has disturbed the balance of the land here, something that has upset the equilibrium between elemental and spiritual forces and allowed elemental corruption to seep into the land. [[Elazar]], who calls himself too old to be an impulsive youngster, but too young to be a trusted elder, has been sounding the alarm without much success, and hopes that [[Kenzo]]’s testimony about the dinosaur attack will help sway the village elders. During the walk, [[Elazar]] tells [[Kenzo]] about some of the [[Kenzo#^304854|plants that grow in the jungle]], and the ki – called arima in the lizardfolk tongue – of the jungle, and they walk past a sacred spot where hutsu grows, imbued with the spirits of the lizardfolk ancestors. Communing with the jungle, [[Kenzo]] gifts his ki to the hutsu spirits, and begins to get a sense of what is wrong: something in the land is drawing too much spiritual energy to itself, leaving the jungle dry and empty of ki. And [[Elazar]] also tells [[Kenzo]] about the land - about how, in the ancient days when the gods walked the earth, the planes were all one, and when the multiverse was separated by Arhat and [[Malik]], strands of extraplanar energy still remained in Taelgar, connected the material plane to magic and spiritual power. One place, called the [[Azta Lekua]], or the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], is particularly rich in these connections. 

Arriving in the village of [[Bedez]], [[Kenzo]] settles in with [[Elazar]], learning the language and the lizardfolk teaches of the spiritual realm from him. [[Elazar]] is particularly invested, as the ancestors gave him a vision, that “the raindrop that will start the river flowing will be a stranger who carries the soul of an ancient forest with him.” During this time, [[Elazar]] introduces [[Kenzo]] to the matriarch of the village, [[Arrosa]], who is finally convinced by [[Kenzo]]’s report of the corruption in the dinosaur’s auras to listen to [[Elazar]] and request help to investigate what is happening. After several weeks of teaching, [[Elazar]] proclaims [[Kenzo]] is ready, and takes him to a place in the jungle, a cave filled with dark water, that [[Elazar]] says is close to the moment of creation, a place where [[Kenzo]] can see the spirit realms.

Here, [[Kenzo]] experiences a [[Kenzo Spirit Journey in Bedez|spirit journey]]. 

As you emerge from your vision, the echoes of the symphony of ki remain with you, the impression of the endless power and combinations of the spiritual power of the music of this realm, and the knowledge it would take many lifetimes to understand all of the possibilities of this symphony. Yet through this experience you have begun to see and hear and as you emerge, your senses are sharpened to the spiritual echoes in Taelgar.

## Narrative

We begin as the party speaks with the ghost of [[Nora Silverspark]]. Although [[Nora Silverspark|Nora]] is reluctant to trust the party, and not sure what, if anything they can do for her or to help this place, some persuasion and the sight of the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]] convinces her to tell her story and help the party understand [[Hagrim]], who is now calling himself [[Morkalan]]. [[Nora Silverspark|Nora]] tells the story of the [[Chalice of the Runepriest#History of the Chalice|history of the chalice]], adding some detail. She says [[Hagrim]] broke in battle against [[Odim Mavdyrson]], perhaps because of some old mind-wounds from the [[Great War]], and when he ordered his troops to attack her, she would not fight back, and was slaughtered. In [[Hagrim]]'s death, this place grew from his evil acts, and has gotten darker since. None can leave and those who wander into the battlefield from the mortal realm are, in many cases, drawn into [[Morkalan]] against their will. [[Hagrim]], [[Morkalan]] now, she says, does not even remember the past. 

From her, they learn that the Mad Priest is actually [[Hagrim]]'s cousin, [[Delig Firebrand]], and if anyone could speak of [[Hagrim]]'s childhood it would be him. As far as she knows, he is still alive in the ashy wastelands, which [[Tak]] says is home to trolls you eat your soul. 

After some debate, the party decides to go look for [[Delig Firebrand]], in the wastes, hoping to get a sense of [[Hagrim]]. 

![[ash-plains.png|500]]

On the way, through the wastes, they fight off a shadowy, necrotic troll, that saps the strength of whomever attacks it. But managing to defeat it, they find [[Delig Firebrand]]. He has lost most of his memories, constantly forgetting who he is talking to, and thinking everyone in the party to be named [[Riswynn]]. But he does talk occasionally about his past, and [[Hagrim]], and how after the [[Great War]] he was a changed man, damaged, with eyes that looked strange. Sometimes he would talk about the evil tentacled creatures that would devour your brain, and shudder. After a pint from [[Rothfis]] and some conversation, [[Delig Firebrand]] seems exhausted, so the party leaves him to rest and heads to find [[Morkalan]]/[[Hagrim]], at the mirror version of the Stoneborn statue.

Approaching the Stoneborn statue, and [[Hagrim]]'s lair, the party makes their way through ghosts of his memories, aided by [[Thror]]'s fly spell and [[Riswynn]]'s holy aura driving undead away. 

![[giant-statue-legs-morkalan.png|500]]
![[morkalan-hagrim-fort.png|500]]
Passing into the dungeon, the party makes their way through a chamber of bones that begin to animate, breaks open the door to [[Hagrim]]'s final resting place, and confronts his ghost. [[Hagrim]] is angry, accusing the party of reminding him of his horrible past, saying he had free himself of his cursed memories until they arrived. And battle is joined, as he insists there is nothing for the party here, and they should leave him to his domain. As he takes damage from the party, and is worn down, he becomes fainter and fainter, but insists he cannot be defeated, and he will be back to finish the job. 

As the ghost of [[Hagrim]] fades, [[Riswynn]] pours the water of the Chalice on his spirit, and tells the [[Bahrazel]] that he deserves redemption, that his evil was at least in part a result of compulsion, or damage from mind flayers in the [[Great War]], and that she believes he yearns for his home. As the water pours from the chalice, the shadows begin to dissolve, and we end the session as the party emerges into the sunlight, surrounded by the bewildered [[Dwarves]] of [[Bleakhold]] now delivered to the plains of [[Dunmar]] in late August. 

[[Merash]] and [[Rothfis]] return to their homes, but [[Thror]] stays with [[Riswynn]] to help the refugees. As the ghost of [[Nora Silverspark|Nora]] fades, she tells [[Riswynn]] where to find her body, and gifts her the [[Silverspark Gauntlets]] she bore. 

Over the next 6 weeks, until mid-October, [[Riswynn]] and [[Thror]] guide the refugees south to a joyous and somber reunion in [[Tharn Todor]]. It takes time and care and patience to help them reintegrate into normal society.

[[Riswynn]], during this time, sends messages to her companions, learning that [[Wellby]], [[Seeker]], [[Delwath]], and[[Kenzo]] faced a green dragon, and then were scattered across the world by strange magic. But they are meeting again near [[Stormcaller Tower]], so [[Riswynn]] sets out again to meet them in mid October. 

During this time, she passes through [[Tokra]], collecting a few letters for the party and checking in with [[Dag Hardstone]] and his family, as well as [[Vistra Fireforge]]. [[Tokra]] is tense, with tensions between [[Sura]] and the army of [[Nayan Karnas]] high; Vistra reports that [[Sura]] holds the hearts of the people here, but without the blessing of the Lakan monks few are willing to risk open war. 

Gathering letters to deliver, [[Riswynn]] heads east, connecting with [[Delwath]] at his camp near the [[Feywild]] crossing where the rest of the party should arrive. ---

## Narrative

We begin in the lizardfolk village of [[Bedez]], where, finally, a group of lizardfolk heroes have gathered before a council of elders. From these, based on the blessings of the ancestors, a few will be chosen to travel with [[Kenzo]] to the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]] and confront whatever is throwing the jungle out of balance. As the council ends, [[Kenzo]] meets [[Izzarak]], the first chosen, who introduces himself as well as the two baby lizardfolk he cares for, who were brought to him by a jaguar who said they must be taken to the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]. The next morning, as [[Kenzo]] and [[Izzarak]] prepare to set out for the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], they are joined by [[Enari]], another lizardfolk, a skilled warrior, tracker, and guide.

The next morning, after some conversation, the party sets off for the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], led by [[Enari]], who has traveled widely and knows the way. The first day’s travel through the jungle is uneventful, marked by [[Izzarak]] communing with the gods to try to understand the dangers they will face, learning that it is the elements – earth, air, fire, water – that will be the dangers in the jungle, and that the forest bleeds. [[Kenzo]] speaks of his vision, of the wounded creature draining the jungle, upsetting the balance of the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]. 

The next day, the party approaches the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], and the volcano that dominates the horizon, a faint red glow of lava visible on its summit, the crackling sound of something in the jungle ahead. The party stops to investigate, and sees a running river of lava cutting through the jungle, sizzling but not burning the trees it passes near. [[Kenzo]] stops to reach out and commune with the forest, senses not only that the elemental [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] is intruding in the world of Taelgar here, but there is a whirlwind, a tornado pulling the energy of the spiritual realms into the center of the Footprint.

Meanwhile, [[Enari]] and [[Izzarak]], watching the river of laval, see racing along the surface, a spirit of fire, dancing in the lava, being chased and attacked by a flaming ankylosaurs and two giant wasps of fire. After debate as to whether and how to intervene in this fight, the party attacks the dinosaur and the wasps. [[Izzarak]] calls upon the power of the stars and takes on the form of a starry dragon constellation, shooting magic bolts of energy, while [[Enari]] stabs with his pike and [[Kenzo]] with his staff, disrupting the ki of these creatures.  

As the battle ends, the magma dancer turns to speak with his apparent saviors. The party learns this creature is called [[Somi-nai]], also known as Sugarra, and he is the volcano, the spirit of the volcano. He tells the party how his home has been overrun with fire, with pure destruction, with none of the rejuvenation that should accompany fire. Although skeptical and even contemptuous of their likelihood of success, [[Somi-nai]] speaks of [[Motua]], the creature at the center of the great whirlwind in the heart of the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], the force that is draining [[Somi-nai]]’s power. He talks of [[Motua]], one of the Gidari (guardians), coming from the veil, the [[Land of the Dead]], for reasons unknown to him, and the destruction that [[Motua]] has wrought. While he has little advice for how to kill the creature, [[Somi-nai]] believes that [[Motua]] must die to restore order and harmony to the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]].  

We end as [[Somi-nai]] returns to his domain, the volcano, and the party contemplates how to cross the running lava river.

As the session opens, the party has just left the council meeting, and rumors are starting to circulate around [[Karawa]] that evil is afoot in the wilds. [[Havdar]] has started to circulate among the people, recruiting those who can ride and fight; the celebratory atmosphere of the fair and games is fading as news and rumor spreads. 

In the afternoon, the party splits up to take care of errands and preparation. [[Delwath]] checks in with people he knows from living in town for several months, and spends some time trading coin for gear and potions. [[Kenzo]] speaks with [[Candrosa]] briefly, who does not have much knowledge about [[Raven's Hold]] in particular. [[Wellby]] goes to talk to the [[Charmhearts]] again, learning that they had a hard time at the market, as [[Ander]] is not improving, and disrupted some of their selling days. [[Callie Charmheart|Callie]] tells [[Wellby]] a bit more about [[Raven's Hold]]: it is set in a river valley a few miles east of the road, near where a small river flows out from the mountains. [[Ander Charmheart|Ander]] approached by walking in the river past the gatehouse of the outer walls, and then across the drier plains towards the inner fortress when he was attacked. 

[[Seeker]] goes to talk to [[Ikram]], to try to learn more about the book he received. [[Ikram]] does not have much more information, but while he is at the caravanserai it is apparent that refugees fleeing the attacks to the south, on [[Bas Udda]] and the agricultural land around it, are starting to arrive in [[Karawa]]. [[Seeker]] also spends some time studying the oddity of the [[Red Mesa]], and the fact that the temple built into it seems to be older than the rock of the mesa itself. 

Late in the afternoon, [[Alesh]] and her two traveling companions come to say goodbye and good luck before they head south to scout in more detail the situation in that direction. They discuss [[Raven's Hold]] briefly, and learn it was a holdfast from before the [[Great War]], and also the site of a trading outpost of the [[Dwarves]] of the southern mountains. 

The next morning, [[Seeker]] spends much of the day helping to fortify the temple of [[Shakun]], where [[Candrosa]] and some other acolytes and mystai of [[Shakun]] will remain when the villagers abandon the town, while the rest of the party finishes any other preparations for their trip. Meeting back at [[Ikram’s]] caravanserai a few hours before the festival of [[Jeevali]]’s rebirth is to begin, the party is introduced to [[Riswynn]] Brawnanvil, a dwarf from the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] who is looking for companions to travel to [[Raven's Hold]]. She is heading to [[Raven's Hold]] to try to recover a lost family heirloom of the Brawnanvil clan, as rumors have reached the [[Dwarves|dwarves]] of the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] that humans from the west have been seeking artifacts left behind in the rush to flee the great upheavals after the [[Great War]]. Not wanting to see their heritage fall into the hands of the humans, an expedition has set forth, but fearing it would not focus on a minor holding far to the east like [[Raven's Hold]], the Brawnanvil clan sent their own treasure hunter. 

After this meeting, the [[Festival of Rebirth]] begins. [[Suma]], the priestess of [[Jeevali]], and a number of litter bearers carry a tall sculpture shaped like a tree, and seemingly made of vines, and dried flowers, and bits of wood and seeds all pulled together into a trunk, with a design that spirals up to a crown of branches and leaves at the top. They carry the sculpture to the desert, where [[Suma]] tells the story of [[Jeevali]]’s miracle. When the Dunmari first settled the land, it was dry and dead, a barren landscape cursed by the plague. The people suffered, and died, from drought and hunger and fear. [[Jeevali]] wept for her people, crying tears that poured from the heavens, cleansing the land and purifying the soil. Rivers sprung up where her tears fell, and the land was blessed. But as she cried, she put so much of her power and spirit into her tears that she began to fade away. She diminished, and was gone. For a year, the people prayed, singing her name every day, calling to her, begging her to return. The harvests that year were bountiful, the lambs and calves and foals healthy and numerous. As the winter rains fell gently on the land, the people prayed and chanted her name. In the spring, as new life began to grow from the fertile soil, [[Jeevali]] also grew from the ground, the power of the belief of her people restoring her.

At the climax of the story, the tree-shrine is set alight. As the shrine catches on fire, as it bursts into flames, it doesn't just burn normally, but pieces of it drift off almost like fireworks floating in all directions, but mostly west. And as these embers drift to the west, a sign goes through the crowd as [[Suma]] says that [[Jeevali]] is with us, [[Jeevali]] is going west and we will follow her. The next morning, the procession that marks the festival is a solemn affair, with none of the usual costumes and flair and joyous dancing. People gather their contributions to the new shrine, and by some trick of the light or by the magic of the gods these all these individual offerings begin to fuse together. 

As this is happening, a murmur starts at the edge of the crowd, which becomes a shout and then screams. The party charges towards the disturbance, seeing three gnolls, creatures that look like a horrible combination of a human and a hyena, with the legs and head of a hyena and the torso of a human, wearing crude armor and carrying nasty short swords. With these gnolls are three monstrous creatures that seem to be giant maws filled with viciously sharp teeth, on four legs. A vicious battle ensues, and eventually the party defeats the attackers, with everybody contributing some key moments. [[Seeker]] dispatches one gnoll with a rune that heats its sword until it catches fire, and puts another to sleep. [[Wellby]] attacks the creatures with arrows from a balcony, as [[Delwath]], [[Kenzo]] and [[Riswynn]] engage up close. Surprisingly, [[Ander Charmheart|Ander]] walks toward the battle, seeming to wish to be devoured by the mouth creatures. [[Seeker]] trips him up by molding the earth into difficult terrain, trying to keep [[Ander Charmheart|Ander]] away, but he continues to struggle forward. [[Seeker]] then uses his stone shaping ability to make a drawing of green vines appear on the ground. Seeing the vines, [[Ander]] becomes terrified and faints. During the fight, [[Kenzo]] is badly wounded, and falls unconscious, barely avoiding death. 

After the battle, the party gets a much needed night of sleep, before preparing to head north at first light. ---

Spend the night in [[Wahacha]].
## Narrative

We begin as [[Wellby]] lands, teleported from far away, onto the deck of the [[Wave Dancer]], a halfling trader making its way east, in the eastern half of [[Green Sea]]. The [[Wave Dancer]] is fleeing hobgoblin pirates from the Devil’s Spine, unwilling to give over their cargo of dragon hide from [[Praznitsky]], and hoping for cover of darkness to slip away. [[Wellby]] uses the [[Raven Whistle]] to fly back towards the hobgoblin ship, where despite the constant hail of arrows, he manages to land on the crow’s nest, kill the sailor there, and, while obscured by the smoke from his pyrotechnic arrow, set the mainsail on fire. Although the [[Hobgoblins]] get the fire under control quickly, the sail is done for and the pirate ship slows enough to allow the [[Wave Dancer]] – aided by magical fog created by the navigator, [[Corrin Wildheart]] – to escape in the night. 

Over the next 10 days, as the [[Wave Dancer]] makes it way to the kenku port of [[Wahacha]] in the eastern isles, [[Wellby]] talks with the halflings on the ship. He tells his tale, and listens to stories of the halflings. They tell of [[Praznitsky]], a closed city in the north, part of the country of Ursk, where none are allowed across the bridge from the harbors and warehouses to the main city, and the people trade dragon hide. They tell [[Medju]], the great spice city in the south, the terminus of trade routes from strange lands across the desert, where you can buy and sell almost anything in the markets of  the obscenely wealthy spice lords. They tell of the anchored island, [[Quanyi]], where sea [[Elves|elves]] live and harvest magical salt from the warm tropical oceans on their shores. And they tell of [[Wahacha]], their destination, a small port in the [[Vermillion Isles]], inhabited by kenku since time immemorial. 

![[wahacha-coast.png|500]]

![[wahacha-village.png|500]]

We end as the [[Wave Dancer]] arrives in [[Wahacha]], and [[Wellby]] is given a tour of the island by [[Makha]], the harbor master and unofficial town spokesperson. From [[Makha]], [[Wellby]] learns that the two kenku wanderers and explorers who could tell him where to find someone who knows about the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]] have recently been kidnapped, by raiders from the sea who have been causing trouble in the last month.

## Timeline

- (DR::1748-09-30):  [[Seeker]] arrives in the [[Feywild]] realm of Fortune’s Rest
- **Afternoon, in the feywild**: [[Seeker]] travels to the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court; meets the [[Prince of Luck]]; agrees to investigate the wild magic storm in exchange for safe passage across the realm.

## Narrative

We begin as [[Seeker]] arrives in the [[Feywild]], in a meadow of flowers that bloom and unfurl into butterflies as their petals open, taking wing and blowing away. Getting his bearings, with the help of [[Typhina]] and the maps and notes of [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]], from [[Chardon]], [[Seeker]] stands trying to look confident in this strange place. A giggle from nearby turns out to come from a small fairy, a pixie, who warns [[Seeker]] he must have the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s permission to travel through his domain of [[Fortune's Rest]], and invites him to come to court, by way of polymorphing him into a dragonfly. 

The court itself is a vast, elegant outdoor casino, staffed by beautiful [[Fey]] in white robes, and filled with games of chance of all kinds. A band of satyrs plays a lively tune, and food and drink flow freely. [[Seeker]] wanders, avoiding food and drink and watching the games, until eventually watching a lizard race and deciding to bet. [[Seeker]] bets on one of the losers, and suffers an explosion of black sticky ooze in his face with a rancid, bitter taste as a consequence, but manages to avoid any more severe effects. 

![[prince-of-luck-court.png|500]]
Eventually [[Seeker]] begins to wander towards the palace in the center of the gardens, although it seems difficult to leave the games and [[Seeker]] ends up wandering for some unknown stretch of time before finding himself in a formal garden just outside the palace. The flowers here do not have normal flowers, but rather dense lobes of light of burnished gold, glowing. Somewhat impulsively, [[Seeker]] reaches out and touches one, which bursts in a flash of light, blinding him.

A quick casting of dispel magic removes the blindness, but catches the attention of the [[Prince of Luck]]. The music stops, and he confronts [[Seeker]], but quickly forgives him, and asks him to come tell his story at court. After some back and forth, discussing what [[Seeker]] wants and where he came from, the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]] offers [[Seeker]] a chance to roll for his favor. [[Seeker]], in a moment of pure chutzpah, decides to use his magic dice to try to win, rolling two six sided dice for a total of thirteen. For a moment it seems as if the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]] will be angry, but then he decides to reward [[Seeker]] for his attempt. 

We end as [[Seeker]] rests in the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court, after agreeing to help resolve the wild magic storm growing on the border of Fortune’s Rest, in exchange for safe passage across the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s domain.

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1748-10-13): Meet [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]] at the Dolphin’s Rest, and learn they are all seeking the lair of the raiders too. Join forces; sail out to sea. 
- (DR:: 1748-10-14): Arrive at lair; fight possessed sharks and enslaved sailors; find and kill aboleth.

## Narrative

We begin our adventure in the [[Vermillion Isles]], in the port town of [[Wahacha]], in the [[Dolphin’s Rest Inn]], an establishment popular with sailors and other ‘grounders’  who visit [[Wahacha]], as it sits at the bottom of the steep red sea cliffs that define the islands, instead of nestled among the sides and tops of the cliffs like many of the kenku buildings. [[Wellby]] is introduced to [[Rufus]], [[Artem Novolozek]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]], all come together here to discuss the problem of the recent raids. After introductions, the group sets out quickly to the spot, about 40 miles to the east on the edge of the [[~Eastern Ocean~]], where the raiders are believed to come from.

After an uneventful day of sailing, the party comes to the likely location they are seeking, seeing both a wrecked ship and several small longboats at anchor above what looks like a large underwater island, a sea mount that nearly reaches the surface. From maybe 200 feet below the water, a faint green glow can be seen. After help from [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] to allow everyone who cannot already breath water to do so, the party dives down. 

They enter an underwater cave, and proceed along to a boulder blocking the entrance to a larger complex, from which the greenish light is leaking. The boulder is easy enough to move, although [[Alimash]] is nearly blinded by the fungal rot growing on it while shoving it aside. 

As the party descends into the cave, the first thing they see are three humans riding giant sharks, seemingly jousting with each other; meanwhile, a giant fan slowly spins in the middle of the floor, pulling fresh water from the sea into the cave itself. The sailors seem dazed, or enchanted, and immediately attack, after first turning the fan speed up so it begins to create a swirling current pulling any who get too close into the blades. 

The party engages in combat, and manages to defeat all the sharks and sailors, although realizes as the sailors die they are unable to breath, and suffocate. The party manages to save one of them via keeping them unconscious until [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] can cast Water Breathing. Speaking to this sailor, he can’t seem to remember much of the past few weeks, but warns them what is waiting below. [[Wellby]] lures a fish into range, bribes it with food, and beast senses in its mind to scout below, seeing first a chamber with the kenku prisoners, a massive shark, and a few more sailors, and then below a  giant tentacles aboleth lurking around a massive crystal prison holding an enormous creature, only one eye of which can occasionally be seen. But then the fish is eaten by the aboleth. 

Proceeding down, after turning off the spinning blades, the party attacks the shark. The battle turns, however, when they realize that there is a mage hiding in the mouth of the shark, who gets off a few deadly spells before [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] polymorphs the shark into a turtle, taking it out of the combat. Eventually, though, the mage is subdued and the prisoners temporarily rescued. But the tentacled aboleth continues to attack through the floor below.

![[aboleth-cave-wahacha.png|500]]
The party descends to its lair, and combat begins, as the aboleth attempts to lure its attackers via images of their greatest desires. Magic and weapons fly as the party works to bring this creature down, along with three enslaved sea elf knights. [[Shoal]] and [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] resist attempts to be lured into visions, and the party manages to largely shrug off attempts to charm them. Until near the end of the battle, [[Rufus]] succumbs to the psychic coral, falling unconscious as a vision of a world without crabs appears before him and then is cruelly taken away. And as the aboleth is nearing death, it manages to charm [[Alimash]] to fight on its side, although this does not last long, as with a blast of lightning [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] kills the beast before it can get full control of [[Alimash]]’s mind. 

We end as the aboleth falls to the floor of the cave, [[Rufus]] unconscious but stabilized by [[Wellby]], and the prisoners dazed as they come out of their enslavement.

## Timeline

- **Afternoon, in the feywild**: [[Seeker]] meets [[Raven]], [[Spirala]], and [[Mikasa]] who are also coming to help solve the wild magic storm. 
- **Slightly later afternoon, in the feywild**: [[Seeker]], [[Raven]], [[Spirala]], and [[Mikasa]] travel to the Crystal Peaks, where the wild magic storm is growing; enter the mountain; meet the strange fey creature [[Illaran]]; fight off animated spells; and stop the wild magic storm.
## Narrative

We begin in the court of the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]], as [[Seeker]] meets his companions who will venture into the wild magic storm: [[Raven]], a Winter Knight from [[Shimmersong]], also bordering the wild magic storm; [[Spirala]], a light cleric from [[Shimmersong]]; and [[Mikasa]], a samurai from a distant fey realm, who is helping in exchange for passage home from the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]. [[Raven]] and [[Spirala]] know the way, so the party sets out from the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court towards the Crystal Peak, at the center of the wild magic storm.

![[crystal-peak.png|500]]

After some time traveling through the wonders of the [[Feywild]], the party approaches the Crystal Peak, a mountain entirely made of gems and crystals. Between [[Spirala]]’s flight, [[Raven]] and [[Mikasa]]’s ability to scale sheer walls, and [[Seeker]] polymorphing into a dragonfly getting to the top is easy. Except for when [[Seeker]] casts Polymorph, something breaks off from the top of the mountain and a giant round stone comes hurling down the mountainside. [[Raven]] and [[Mikasa]] are able to dodge out of the way, fortunately. 

The top of the mountain has a giant crater, as if something crashed into it, leaving an open gash that leads down into a cave structure below. The cave is almost like a massive bubble in the mountain, and at the bottom is a crashed geode, split open. Descending to investigate, giant dragonfly [[Seeker]] is swarmed and attacked by an animated cloud of crystal fragments. [[Raven]] and [[Mikasa]] run down the walls of the cave, trying to draw the attention of the clouds of crystal fragments, while [[Spirala]] and [[Seeker]] fly down. 

As the party deals with the crystal shards, [[Seeker]] casts Catapult to try to break one of the swarms to pieces, and vanishes, appearing in another cave, that looks inhabited. The rest of the party manages to deal with the crystal fragments, and find their way to the room [[Seeker]] is in, on the next level down.

Here, the party meets [[Illaran]], a strange fey creature with wild hair, a multicolored frizzy mess, and clearly a master of this crystal mountain domain. [[Illaran]] is somewhat shifty, and not completely straightforward with the party. But it seems that after the crash, which leaked some kind of uncontrolled magic, [[Illaran]] summoned a creature with a nose for gems to help, and it ended up swallowing the shards of the geode. After which things started to go heywire, and magic got weird. [[Illaran]] tried to kill the creature with magic, but it fled, deeper into the mountain. Somehow, the creature needs to be destroyed, and the geode shards retrieved and destroyed, to end the chaos. Unfortunately, [[Illaran]] admits, the spells he cast came alive (some aftereffect of the geode, he thinks), and might be waiting for the party. Still, it is the only way, he says, so the party proceeds.

[[Illaran]] leads them to another cave, with polished reflective crystal walls, where they find a portal to the deep cave where the creature, a xorn, can be found. The creature has been petrified by the chaotic magic, turned to a statue of stone - surrounded by living versions of all the spells that [[Illaran]] or the party cast in the mountain, which immediately attack. While [[Raven]], [[Spirala]], and [[Seeker]] try to hold off the wild magic, [[Mikasa]] lunges for the statute, attempting to crack it in two to shatter the magic crystal and end the wild magic storm. 

[[Spirala]] manages to temporarily paralyze one of the spells with Dispel Magic, and [[Raven]] holds off a number of smaller, weaker spells, along with the echo of the giant dragonfly [[Seeker]] polymorphed into. However, [[Illaran]]’s lightning bolt and force hand, as well as [[Seeker]]’s catapult, are real trouble. Fortunately, [[Mikasa]] is able to crack open the statue. As it cracks, the room vibrates for a moment, and with a last wild burst of chaotic magic energy, the storm ends and magic begins to rebalance.

We end as [[Seeker]], [[Spirala]], and [[Raven]] continue their journey to [[Shimmersong]] and beyond, in search of the fey crossing that will reunite [[Seeker]] with his friends, as [[Mikasa]] returns to receive her favor from the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]] and go home. But not before a grateful [[Illaran]] gifts [[Seeker]] fragments of crystalized magic, from a mysterious source, to do with what he will. 

The source of the geode, which caused the wild magic storm and the living spells, remains mysterious; and [[Illaran]] won't reveal where he came by or created the crystalized magic he gave to [[Seeker]]. But, at least to [[Seeker]]'s eyes, they seem unrelated. ---

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1748-11-06): Speak with [[Somi-nai]]. Cross the lava river, and proceed to the flooded jungle. Commune with an ancient tree; find the dryad [[Eleuha]]; avoid a maelstrom whirlpool dragging everything it touches into an endless watery void; confront [[Motua]] and heal their wounds, freeing them of the bindings that weakened and sickened them; meet [[Lengau]], the jaguar spirit guardian of the jungle.
- (DR:: 1748-11-07) - (DR_end:: 1748-11-12):  Spend time in the jungle with [[Motua]] and [[Lengau]]
- (DR:: 1748-11-13):  [[Izzarak]] decides to remain and care for the babies, whatever they will become; [[Kenzo]] plane-shifted to the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]], to Lastlight Falls, by the magic of [[Lengau]]

## Narrative

We begin at the edge of a river of lava in the jungle, the party considering how to cross. [[Kenzo]] easily jumps the distance, while [[Izzarak]] polymorphs into a pterodactyl to fly across with [[Enari]]. Proceeding into the jungle from the other side after a brief rest, [[Kenzo]], [[Enari]], and [[Izzarak]] find themselves heading towards a large expanse of flooded jungle. 

Venturing into the flooded area, with the two lizardfolk swimming comfortably and [[Kenzo]] running across the water, [[Kenzo]] looks for a tree to speak with, to understand more about what is happening here. Communing with one of the biggest and older trees he can find, [[Kenzo]] speaks with Tree. Tree complains that everything has fled the jungle, the birds no longer sing in his hair and his roots are wet, and it is caused by [[Motua]]. Tree then tells [[Kenzo]], who is hoping for more information about [[Motua]] and the jungle, to speak with his children, specifically his daughter-tree who is inhabited by a spirit of the jungle. [[Kenzo]] listens to [[Tree’s story]], collecting it for the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], and then reverently ends his communion with Tree. 

The party heads into the water in search of Tree’s daughter, noticing as they do that there is a current that is getting stronger and stronger as they head into the center of the jungle, following [[Kenzo]]’s intuition and sense of the jungle to find the right way to reach Tree’s daughter. After finding the tree-spirit, [[Eleuha]], [[Kenzo]] speaks with her. She knows the babies that [[Izzarak]] defends, saying they are the children of [[Lengau]], the spirit of the jungle, and giving [[Kenzo]] a hard time for a mediocre babysitting skills ([[Izzarak]] and [[Enari]] are scouting underwater). [[Eleuha]] tells them that [[Lengau]] has fallen silent, been lost, an thinks it has something to do with [[Motua]]’s arrival. The babies are the newest children of [[Lengau]]: shapeshifters, children unfixed in form, typically cared for by the jungle, taking on the form of those they love. Every once and while, when [[Lengau]] grows old and tired, one of his children will become him reborn, become the new guardian of this land. [[Eleuha]], the dryad, also tells them that if [[Motua]] would go away, somehow, it feels to her like [[Lengau]] would return and all of the troubles of the jungle could be fixed.

The party follows the current, pulling them closer to the maelstrom of water that forms a vortex to the elemental plane of Water. Despite a few tense moments, as [[Kenzo]] falls and is forced to swim before being dragged to safety by [[Enari]], and [[Izzarak]] needs to turn into a fish to make his way past the strong currents, the party mangages to navigate around the whirlpool vortex and finds themselves in a densely overgrown, misty island of dry land at the center of the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]].

The party cautiously moves through the understory, the occasional glimpse of a serpent-like creature moving in the corner of their eyes, until [[Kenzo]] stops and yells “[[Motua]]! We are here to end your pain, we are here to help!” Suddenly, appearing in front of the party, is [[Motua]], a thirty foot long serpentine creature, feathered, with an almost cat-like head, and with three wounds cut through its body, from each wound three writhing black chains of dark, necortic energy binding [[Motua]]. 

Screaming in pain, [[Motua]] attacks, swinging their tail at [[Kenzo]], who dodges at first, but then is struck, seeing in the moment of contact that the wounds are not physical wounds, or not just physical wounds, they (and the chains) extent to the spiritual realm as well, fragments of dreams buried in the wounds. [[Kenzo]] reaches out and becomes part of the wound.

[[Kenzo]] sees a lonely warrior, nondescript, at the end of their life, forgotten, afraid of dying alone and nobody caring, their sword hanging uselessly at their side. They look up, saying “I am forgotten, aren’t I. No one remembers me.” His dejected, lonely face turns to surprise when [[Kenzo]] offers to [[Nameless Chardonian Warrior's Story|tell his story]], collecting it for the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], despite the warrior’s insistence that his life had little meaning, his captain the one who won glory in battle, his brother who achieved wealth in life, with a beautiful family and accomplished children. As he tells his story, the image of the warrior fades, and the face of [[Motua]] appears.

“No. That is not my story. I am eternal. I protected souls like him. Until a year ago, a creature came to the River of the Dead, a shadowy, skeletal figure, where a long black cloak, carrying a wicked glaive, and wearing a burning ring of dark fire on his hand.” 

Meanwhile, in the jungle, as the first wound closes the chains slither forward, attacking [[Izzarak]], as shadows begin to emerge from the ground, bearing down on [[Enari]]. As [[Izzarak]] animates the forest to fight back against the chains, [[Kenzo]] merges with the second wound.

[[Kenzo]] sees a nondescript traveler in a vast, empty desert, lost, dying of thirst, seeming to be trying to scratch out a letter or a note on a stone. She looks up as you appear, croaking, “I am dying. I have no paper to write with.” [[Kenzo]] offers to tell her story, asking her what must be written, that they can do this together, but she says she just needs to write a letter to her family, one more time, tell them they are loved, tell them that she lived a good life, that she knew the risks, that they should not refuse to live their lives because she is gone. 

As [[Kenzo]] asks her name, she begins to fade, and emerging from her mouth is a miniature version of [[Motua]], who begins to grow. “They do not have names anymore,” [[Motua]] says, and continues telling their story. “The creature, the skeleton, he carried with him a scroll, an ancient thing of power. As he spoke the words on the scroll, it burst into dark fire and turned to ash, and the ring grew brighter, wrapping around his glaive, encasing it flames of shadow. As he walked, he burned marks with his glaive in the very fabric of the land, marks that pulsed with a heartbeat, with life in this lifeless place. And I could not let that stand.”

In the jungle, although [[Izzarak]] has destroyed some of the first set of chains, three more chains burst forth as the second wound begins to close. With the necrotic shadows clawing at him, [[Kenzo]] enters the third and final wound. 

[[Kenzo]] sees a holy warrior, a paladin, fighting a hopeless battle against dozens of monsters, their forms constantly shifting. Behind them is a door, and people fleeing, trying to get out, trying to escape, while the paladin stands holding back the horde. The warrior, seeing [[Kenzo]], speaks: “I don’t know how long I can last. I am afraid of dying, afraid it will hurt. My spirit may not be strong enough to hold on, for everyone to flee.” [[Kenzo]] offers to tell his story, ensure it lives forever, but the warrior does not seem to care. “I do not fear the death of my story,” he says, “I fear that I will not have the strength to do the right thing, that even with my sacrifice it will not be enough, and I will be damned, my soul consumed by the Nine Hells.” [[Kenzo]] moves to join the warrior in the fight, but it does not seem to be enough, or what is needed, to heal this wound.

Meanwhile, in the jungle, [[Izzarak]] continues his battle against these chains. The wrath of the jungle manages to destroy some of them, but the rest swarm around [[Izzarak]], battering him. 

In the wound, [[Kenzo]] sees the warrior looking around in a panic. “I don’t think it matters what I do, I can feel the cage closing in on me. I’m just going to run, there is no redemption for me.” As [[Kenzo]] throws all his strength at the warrior, draining his own energy, he experiences the sweep of the warrior’s life. Growing up on the streets, no parents, never finding anyone to give him a helping hand. Turning to thievery, banditry, eventually robbing caravans. In middle age, a price on his head, finding his way to a Temple of the Wilding (one of the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]]), saying to the priest that he cannot go on like this. Rumors of monster attacks, trolls raiding villages, asking the priest if it would be enough, if he repaid what was taken from them. The priest assuring him that the Wilding will look after him. [[Kenzo]], then, turning to him, telling him, “I know your story. I know your journey. I’ve walked the path myself. I grew up with no parents, I grew up alone, poisoned, abused. It was only by sheer luck I was taken in by someone who could teach me. Redemption is before you.” As [[Kenzo]] finishes speaking, the warrior runs into battle, and the wound closes. 

And [[Kenzo]] sees now that it is not the warrior fighting, it is [[Motua]]. They are in a battle with the skeletal creature – [[Grash]] – and with each swing of the glaive, each strike, a gaping wound opens, and from each wound necrotic chains emerge, binding [[Motua]]. [[Motua]] becomes weaker and weaker, moving slower and then not at all, tumbling from the [[Land of the Dead]]. As they do, [[Grash]] staggers back, exhausted but triumphant, the ring on his hand glowing, tendrils of energy reaching out from it, grasping souls from the [[Land of the Dead]], pulling them through the marks that [[Grash]] carved with his glaive and the magic of an ancient scroll. 

As [[Kenzo]] emerges again, battling the last of these necrotic chains with [[Izzarak]], one manages to penetrate his soul, wrapping around him, but the rest are defeated, and [[Motua]] goes calm. They bow their head in gratitude, and [[Motua]] and [[Kenzo]] commune together, experiencing a vision of the thousands of souls [[Motua]] has sheparded to their fates. In their communion, [[Kenzo]] senses the rush of ki, the richness of the symphony of ki here in the jungle, which flows into his staff. 

Meanwhile, the party hears the low growl of a jaguar pacing through the jungle – [[Lengau]]. He approaches, greeting the babies, thanking [[Izzarak]] for keeping open the door through which [[Lengau]] could travel, clearly implying that it was only the presence of the babies [[Izzarak]] guarded and guided to this place that allows [[Lengau]] to appear here. [[Lengau]] says he will restore the jungle, with [[Motua]]’s help; [[Izzarak]] also volunteers to remain and raise the babies here, and see how he can help bring the jungle back into balance. 

We end as [[Kenzo]] prepares to depart to the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]], after spending some time learning from [[Motua]] and [[Lengau]], to be plane-shifted to Lastlight Falls, where he will meet his friends in the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]].

## Timeline

- **Later afternoon, in the feywild**: [[Seeker]], [[Raven]], and [[Spirala]] travel to [[Shimmersong]] and the Summer Court of the [[Lightdancer]]. [[Seeker]] spends time in [[Shimmersong]] learning about the shards of crystalized magic gifted by [[Illaran]], and crafting a [[Glove of Crystalized Magic|magic glove]] to manipulate magic. 
- **Evening, in the feywild**: [[Seeker]], [[Raven]], and [[Spirala]] meet [[Caulaus]], a strange human who can guide them to Lastlight Falls. They enter the fallen fey realm of [[Amberglow]]; fight a cursed giant who takes memories as a toll for passage; meet [[Lady Eventide]] who takes color from [[Seeker]]’s hair; make their way past the haunted shadows of [[Amberglow]] to Lastlight Falls.

## Narrative

We begin in the fey realm of [[Shimmersong]], where [[Raven]] and [[Spirala]] have brought [[Seeker]], in order for rest and also learn more about the fey crossing he is searching for. After spending some time in [[Shimmersong]], during which [[Seeker]] explored and spent time constructing a magical glove with the shards of crystalized magic to let him manipulate spells, the party has left for [[Amberglow]], where Lastlight Falls – the fey crossing [[Seeker]] is searching for – is located.

[[Amberglow]] is a decaying realm, in disrepair since the Queen of Sunsets, the archfey of [[Amberglow]], vanished many years ago. To travel there needs a guide, and [[Raven]] knows one: the strange human warrior [[Caulaus]] Aportino. 

[[Caulaus]] leads the party into [[Amberglow]], through the Golden Hills on the border of [[Amberglow]] and [[Shimmersong]], to Longshadow Ravine, the only clear path out of the hills into the plains of [[Amberglow]]. However, the ravine is guarded by a cursed giant with an evil glare, [[Vondar]] One-Eye, who the party later learns demands a toll of a memory to pass. Refusing to pay the toll, the party fights, trying to avoid the cursed eye. As the party wears the giant down, the combat seems to be going their way, until [[Seeker]] is cursed by [[Vondar]]’s glare. Nonetheless the party defeats the giant, removes the curse on [[Seeker]], and investigates the camp, wondering about the cauldron of bubbling memories. [[Seeker]] is nearly pulled into the cauldron before being dragged away by his friends, and the party realizes the better part of valor is not messing with strange fey things they don’t understand, and leave. 

Beyond the Golden HIlls and [[Vondar]]’s ravine is a vast expanse of open plains, presumably once beautiful in the evening light of sunset, now dry and pale. To find Lastlight Falls, the first goal is to find the crashed Cloud Palace, where the [[Lady Eventide]], one of the few of the [[Cloudspinner]]’s court who remains in [[Amberglow]], resides. The palace is a wreck, twisted and broken and drained of color. [[Lady Eventide]] is wearing elegant dress and courtly jewelry, but her skin and nearly all her clothes and hair are bleached pale and colorless. 

![[amberglow-cloud-palace.png|500]]

[[Lady Eventide]] and [[Caulaus]] speak about their apparent shared history, with the Lady telling [[Caulaus]] he cannot leave, and cannot be forgiven until the [[Cloudspinner]] returns, since it was her that [[Caulaus]] wronged. Until then, he must remain in the [[Feywild]]. Speaking with [[Seeker]], [[Lady Eventide]] asks what he will give in exchange for a way across the fey crossing at Lastlight Falls. Pale and colorless, she asks for the color of his beard, and eventually agrees to take instead a streak of color from his hair. In exchange, she gives him a [[Sunset Thread|thread]] from her dress, made by the [[Cloudspinner]], who as known for her way with spinning thread of magic from the colors of the sunset. 

The party is then told the way to proceed, past a line of trees that guard Lastlight Falls, and to be careful not to touch the shadows of the trees. The party manages to move forward carefully, avoiding most of the dangers of the shadows, and passing through the trees to the sight of Lastlight Falls. 

We end as [[Raven]] leaves to return to the defense of [[Shimmersong]], and [[Spirala]], [[Seeker]], and [[Caulaus]] see on the top of the cliffs of Lastlight Falls, [[Kenzo]] sitting and waiting. ---

[[Wellby]] is plane shifted to Lastlight Falls, the fey crossing near [[Stormcaller Tower]] in the north of [[Dunmar]], by [[Arryn]]’s magic.
## Narrative

We begin in the aboleth’s cave as [[Rufus]], [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]], [[Shoal]], [[Alimash]], and [[Wellby]] deal with the aftermath of that creature’s death, and the dazed confusion of the prisoners and slaves of the aboleth coming out of their charmed state. As others tend to the prisoners, [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] immediately moves to recover the remorhaz heart, explaining that this rare treasure is his price for freedom. [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] is fleeing from Ursk, a magocracy run by eight families of wizards, known as the rodnye; the exact reasons for his flight are unclear, but the party gathers he was unwilling to pay a price asked of him. The remorhaz heart is to be traded with a partron in [[Medju]] who has the means to ensure his safe escape from the scrying eyes of the rodnye of Ursk. As [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] gathers his treasure, he also examines the massive amber prison for some creature that none wish to see freed, and suggests that perhaps this is best left alone and undisturbed.

Meanwhile, the discussion turns to the prisoners. The two kenku – [[Nahto]] and [[Skoda]] – tell [[Wellby]] that the person he seeks is a wizard known as [[Arryn]] the Wanderer, originally from the western edge of [[Green Sea]], and quite interested in the nature of the multiverse. He would surely know how to send [[Wellby]] to the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]]. Unfortunately, his apprentice, Ressena, the formerly enslaved mage, tells the party that [[Arryn]] is missing. He was experimenting with trying to reach the hypothesized [[Mirror Realm]], when [[Resenna]] heard a crash and a hand reached out of the reflective side of a silver water pitcher to try to grab her. She dodged and ran to investigate, but her master was nowhere to be seen, until she saw his reflection darting from shard to shard in the reflections of broken glass. When her reflection appeared and tried to grab her again, she fled, but was caught by the aboleth’s raiders on her way south to [[Medju]]. 

As the party heads above water to return to [[Wahacha]] and prepare for the journey north to [[Arryn’s Tower]], they are confronted with the realization that the prisoners of the aboleth have been sickened with some disease that causes their skin to burn when exposed to air for more than a handful of minutes. The sea elves volunteer to shelter the freed captives (who retain the ability to breath underwater while the disease infects them) until a cure can be found, while the party gathers supplies for the journey north, and [[Nahto]] repairs [[Wellby]]’s kenku armor to allow him to activate the wings that were previously broken. 

Finally, [[Alimash]], [[Wellby]], and [[Shoal]] head north in a small sailing boat, navigating their way north towards [[Arryn’s Tower]]. past the oddities and sights of the Eastern Isles: a small island with an incredibly dense pine forest, no signs of cities or towns, but small lights moving in the darkness through the trees as the adventurers ride at anchor for the night off the coast; a sheltered harbor in what appears to be a coral atoll, except all the coral has turned to solid stone; a flat island, covered in a vast expanse of salt marsh and shallow dunes just barely above the ocean, moving fast in the current seemingly unmoored from whatever keeps these islands roughly in place, with lizardfolk on the shore swimming and playing in the water. 

The party arrives at the small island on which [[Arryn’s Tower]] stands, mooring on the long dock that, while obviously in use recently, is currently deserted. Following the path, the party approaches the tower. While [[Wellby]] begins to inspect the door, shards of glass spread around the outside entrance – seemingly from several broken mirrors – begin to swirl into swarms and animate, attacking the party. [[Wellby]] makes a few attempts at unlocking the door, but in the chaos of battle finds it difficult, and instead turns to fight. The party manages to reduce the glass swarms to dust in short order, and with time to study the door quickly yields to [[Wellby]]’s lockpicking skill. 

The first floor of the tower is a entryway and an elaborate audience chamber, where all reflective surfaces seem to have been removed or dirtied with soot and lard to prevent reflections. Some experimentation with pools of water reveals that reflections animate, and move separately from the person they are reflecting, to the point that [[Wellby]]’s mirror hand begins to reach out of a puddle of water and try to grab [[Wellby]]. After some further experimenting with reflections, the party heads up the stairs to continue exploring. 

The second floor – kitchens and servant’s quarters – is not deserted. The party finds [[Gyles]], [[Arryn]]’s steward, here. He is not doing well, struggling to deal with the chaos of what is happening in the tower. It takes some convincing, but the party eventually gets him to believe they are real. He tells them that after [[Arryn]] vanished, [[Resenna]] told him to run, but he refused to abandon [[Arryn]] or the place he had called home for more than 15 years. But then a mirror reflection of himself tried to emerge from a mirror and take him over. He smashed the mirrors, but was too scared to leave the tower, afraid of the reflections in the ocean. He suspects [[Arryn]] has been taken into the [[Mirror Realm]]. 

As the conversation progresses and it becomes clear the party may need to distinguish between the mirror [[Arryn]] and the real [[Arryn]], [[Shoal]] asks [[Gyles]] for something about [[Arryn]] that only [[Arryn]] would know, and is told about when they were coming east, on a halfling ship, [[Arryn]] sang the Lost Lads of [[Tollen]], the only time he’d ever heard him sing. 

The party flies to the top of the tower, avoiding whatever dangers lie on the 3rd floor. It takes some time and convincing a raccoon to investigate, but they find the location of [[Arryn]]’s notes with clues to the [[Mirror Realm]]. The raccoon also ends up in the [[Mirror Realm]] itself, and sees two wizards wandering around, confirming that both the (presumably) real [[Arryn]] and the duplicate [[Arryn]] are still alive. From [[Arryn]]’s notes and observation of the raccoon, the party learns that in order for the real [[Arryn]] to be returned to this world, the duplicate [[Arryn]] must be destroyed. 

After some discussion of how to proceed, the party decides that [[Wellby]] will use his smoke arrow to obscure the room with the mirrors at the top of the tower, and everyone will rush around covering the mirrors with drapes and sheets so that they can control the creation of duplicates. Then [[Alimash]] will enter the [[Mirror Realm]] to try to figure out which is the real [[Arryn]] and kill the duplicate, while [[Wellby]] and [[Shoal]] (presumably) deal with the [[Alimash]] duplicate that appears on this end. 

The plan immediately faces complications, however, when [[Alimash]] speaks to an [[Arryn]] and realizes the wizard does not remember the real world and that magic does not work in the [[Mirror Realm]], while at the same time mirror-[[Alimash]] charges [[Wellby]] in a rage. As [[Wellby]] and [[Shoal]] battle mirror-[[Alimash]], real [[Alimash]] pushes the [[Arryn]] version away, after humming the Lost Lads of [[Tollen]] to him with no effect, and runs down two flights of stairs to talk to the other [[Arryn]], where the conversation repeats. [[Wellby]] and [[Shoal]] attempt to restrain mirror-[[Alimash]] to give real-[[Alimash]] time, while real-[[Alimash]] hums again to the other [[Arryn]], who recognizes the tune. [[Alimash]] immediately stabs the first [[Arryn]], who shatters into thousands of tiny silver shards as the real [[Arryn]] fades and begins to reappear in the real world. At that moment, [[Shoal]] strikes with all his power at the now-restrained mirror-[[Alimash]], who likewise shatters into thousands of pieces as the real [[Alimash]] emerges. 

Quickly, restored to his memories and powers, [[Arryn]] closes the portal to the [[Mirror Realm]], severing the connection, and turns to thank [[Wellby]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]] profusely. After giving gifts to [[Alimash]] (a ring of mind shielding) and [[Shoal]] (a deck of beautiful illusions), [[Wellby]] asks about the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]]. [[Arryn]] gifts him a necklace enchanted with moonlight as a gift to secure an honorable Fey guide, and the plane-shifts him to Lastlight Falls, the portal in northern [[Dunmar]] where [[Wellby]] will meet his friends.

Our session begins at Lastlight Falls in the fey realm of [[Amberglow]], where [[Seeker]] has come with the aid of [[Caulaus]], [[Raven]], and [[Spirala]], though [[Raven]] and [[Spirala]] have returned to [[Shimmersong]].  [[Kenzo]] is waiting, and [[Wellby]] arrives shortly afterward. Lastlight Falls is a place close to the [[Cloudspinner]]'s attention, and the session begins with her [[Cloudspinner#^97cec2|memories]]. 

![[amberglow-lastlight-falls.png|600]]

[[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] are introduced to [[Caulaus]], which involves a bit of discussion over [[Caulaus]]' evident confusion over the current time. [[Caulaus]] speaks of [[Drankor]], and a battle against dragons, and fleeing. But even after questioning, he remembers little else: his appointment ceremony with [[Helea]], a feast with [[Elves|elves]] perhaps on the frontier somewhere, but no details the party asks after. 

As [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and [[Kenzo]] great each other in reunion, attention turns to [[Typhina]], who warns [[Seeker]] telepathically that there are dangers here, and she has enemies. The grove she defended, and the place where she claims she can be resurrected, is near, and she suggests heading there quickly, as [[Wellby]] spies flying creatures in the distance, but closing fast. 

The party sets off at a quick pace, hoping to outrun the creatures, while [[Typhina]] describes the Heartwood Grove and the tree of the essence of wood. However, the creatures gain, slowly but surely, and the party is forced to find a defensible position, recognizing they are harpies. The battle is not that difficult, except that [[Seeker]] is lured and charmed by them, as they keep insisting that he give them [[Agata|Dasoclese]] (which [[Typhina]] says is her name, here, once, long ago). It seems they are seeking revenge against her, for some slight in the distant past. Still, the battle progresses, and as the harpies die one by one, they shift their forms into [[Fey]] women of different forms. As some turn to flee and [[Kenzo]] stuns the rest, the battle ends. 

The party bargins to exchange the answers to three questions, and agreeing not to use her charms or songs on any of them for a day, for the lives of the remaining harpies. From the harpies, they learn that Dasocles is an ancient fey, who once claimed to be a guardian of these parts. The harpies seek revenge on her, for the wrongs she did to their people. And they do not know how to end their curse, except perhaps should the [[Cloudspinner]] return. 

[[Typhina]] explains some of her history with the harpies, and claims not to have cursed them; instead, she simply kept them from the forest as gently as she could (although later relevalations call the true of this into question). 

From here, the party proceeds, crossing the dry riverbed of the River of Time that no longer flows here, and finding the grotto of the nymph [[Melusine]], supposedly an old friend and ally of [[Typhina]].

![[amberglow-nymph-grotto.png|600]]

The party speaks with [[Typhina]] and [[Melusine]], about [[Agata]], and the fey, and [[Ring of the Warded Mind#Typhina's Story|Typhina's story]], but come to no real conclusions and decide to continue to the Heartwood Grove.

The party arrives in the grove, seeing the massive tree before them, and [[Seeker]] steps forward to give the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]] to the tree, when evil laughter begins to echo through the woods. Emerging from the ring, reformed, is not [[Typhina]], but [[Agata]] Dustmother, who has been pretending to be [[Typhina]] for months. 

![[amberglow-heartwood-grove.png|600]]

[[Agata]] greets the party cheerfully, thanking them for the chaos they have caused in her name ("The best civil war is always one where every side believes they are righteous"), and offers to send them back to the material plane. Before she can finish speaking, [[Wellby]] attacks, and the battle is joined. The party, however, has gotten much stronger since they last faced [[Agata]], and she does not present a lethal danger. [[Caulaus]] with his echo deal an incredible amount of damage, including the killing blow, aided by [[Kenzo]]'s stunning strike.

[[Kenzo]] speaks with the elder tree of the grove, asking what is to be done. The grove asks for a new guardian, and [[Caulaus]] agrees to take on the role, until the [[Cloudspinner]] returns and he can make amends for the wrongs he cannot remember. And so [[Agata]] is imprisoned in a tree, a fate she imposed on so many, and the party listens to [[Caulaus]]' story before they leave, which [[Kenzo]] [[Caulaus' Story|records]].

We end the session as the party returns to Lastlight Falls and exits the [[Feywild]] at sunset, to see [[Delwath]] camped, waiting for them on the other side.

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1748-11-15): [[Wellby]], [[Seeker]], and [[Kenzo]] exit the [[Feywild]] at sunset, and are reunited with  [[Delwath]] and [[Riswynn]].

## Narrative

We begin as the party meets again, all together after a long absence. Everyone returns from their adventures changed, more or less, and eager to be reunited. Over the campfire, the party tells their stories. 

![[lastlight-falls-dunmar-side.png|600]]

[[Delwath]] speaks of how he [[Session 53 (DuFr)|found himself]] in the Deno’qai forests in the far north, a land once known as the [[Forest of Dreams]], but now called the [[Forest of Nightmares]] as it was cursed during the [[Great War]] against Cha’mutte. Traveling with the [[Stoneborn]] paladin [[Aristaea]] Mountainhands, and the Deno’qai wildfire druid [[Iascaire]], Delwath sought to  [[Session 54 (DuFr)|restore the lost tanshi]] trapped by Cha’mutte’s evil on  [[Session 55 (DuFr)|the battlefields]] of the Great War.

[[Riswynn]] speaks of her adventures, and apologizes for vanishing. After grabbing the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]], she found herself in [[Heart of the Mountain]], the realm of the dwarven gods. Here, she met other [[Dwarves]] summoned to fulfill a debt to the Barahzel: [[Thror]] Redpeak, a storm sorcerer; [[Rothfis]] Stonefist, a bartender and monk;  and [[Merash]] Emberfoot, a smith and warrior. Together,  [[Session 56 (DuFr)|they investigated]] the Shadowfell realm of Morkalan and  [[Session 58 (DuFr)|uncovered]] the tragic story of the loss of the Chalice in the years after the Great War.

[[Kenzo]] speaks of [[Session 57 (DuFr)|his time]] in the jungles of the [[Lizardfolk]], far to the east, in the [[Lizardfolk]] kingdom of [[Orekatu]]. Here, he learned about the spiritual realms from the spirit guide [[Elazar]], who told him of a place, called the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], where the borders between planes are thin. With the [[Lizardfolk]] druid Izarrak and their guide, [[Enari]], [[Kenzo]] traveled [[Session 59 (DuFr)|to the Footprint of the Gods]] to seek out whatever was disrupting the balance of the planes and allowing destructive elemental power to spill into Taelgar, and [[Session 64 (DuFr)|restored harmony and balance]] by healing the wounded spirit creature Motua.

[[Wellby]] found himself on the [[Wave Dancer]], a [[Halflings|halfling]] ship in the middle of [[Green Sea]], [[Session 60 (DuFr)|fleeing from hobgoblin pirates]]. Eventually docking at the kenku port of [[Wahacha]] in the [[Vermillion Isles]], part of the vast, magical chain of islands that separate [[Green Sea]] from the [[~Eastern Ocean~]], [[Wellby]] met up with the wizard [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] Novolozek, the kenku monster hunter [[Rufus]], the sea [[Elves]] warrior [[Shoal]], and the human sailor and warrior [[Alimash]] to  [[Session 62 (DuFr)|seek out raiders]] who had been kidnapping people from ships in the area. After solving that mystery, [[Wellby]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]] headed north to  [[Session 66 (DuFr)|rescue the wizard]] [[Arryn|Arryn the Wanderer]], who had vanished from his tower while experimenting with the magic of the Plane of Mirrors.

[[Seeker]] [[Session 61 (DuFr)|found himself]] in the [[Feywild]], in the [[Fortune's Rest|domain of the Chanceweaver]], the [[Prince of Luck]]. At the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court, he learned of a wild magic storm on the border of Fortune’s Rest and [[Shimmersong]], and travels with [[Raven]], a fae monk of the Winter Knights of [[Shimmersong]]; [[Spirala]] Hollytwist a fairy cleric of the light, also of [[Shimmersong]]; and [[Mikasa]], a fae samurai to [[Session 63 (DuFr)|calm the wild magic]]. After doing so, [[Mikasa]] departs for her home, while [[Raven]], [[Spirala]], and [[Seeker]] meet the human warrior [[Caulaus]] Aportino who [[Session 65 (DuFr)|guides them to the fey crossing]] at Lastlight Falls in the ruined abandoned fey realm of Amberglow.

During the conversation, the party reads letters from [[Tokra]] and elsewhere, and [[Delwath]] reports on the information he has learned from scrying in [[Scrying Delwath Oct 21|mid October]], [[Scrying Delwath Oct 26|late October]], and [[Scrying Delwath Nov 15|mid November]], and from a [[Interlude (Delwath Postscript)#Dunmar Rumors|week spent on the plains of Dunmar]]. The key facts include:
- [[Dunmar]] is on the bring of civil war: [[Nayan Karnas]] has seemingly not spoken to [[Johar]]; [[Havdar]] is turning bloodthirsty under the sway of a cursed sword; and the Lakan monks have not done anything yet.
- [[Kadmos]] and company, now traveling with a subdued [[Vola]] (whether due to mundane or magical coercion is not entirely clear), are crossing [[Dunmar]].
- [[Grash]] is preparing to march east, and soon, with a large army of [[Orcs]] and undead, presumably to recover the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] which was, according to [[Govir]]'s research, lost in a fortification of the [[Aagir Mystai]] to the east during the [[Great War]]. 
- A man in [[Ursk]] named [[Radomir]] found a [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]], and it is now apparently in the possession of someone or something called Rodnya Voknaz.

The party decides to first try to restore [[Hralgar]], and then likely head east to attempt to beat [[Grash]] to the [[Cloak of Rainbows]].

We end late at night, as the party prepares to look in the mirror and then sleep. ---

## Narrative

We begin as the party settles in for the night outside Lastlight Falls, after a long evening of talking and reconnecting. In the morning, [[Riswynn]] prepares the magic she needs to attempt to free [[Kenzo]] from the cursed chain bound to his soul from his encounter with [[Motua]]. The ritual succeeds, with the aid of the prayers of [[Delwath]] to the tanshi and [[Seeker]]'s runic inspiration magic, and [[Kenzo]] is freed, at the cost of the [[Horn of Silent Alarm]] carried for many months. 

Over the course of the next week, the party falls into a routine as they hurry across the plains of [[Dunmar]], now sprung to life with the monsoon rains.

![[dunmar-november-1748.png]]

[[Riswynn]] prays each morning to the Baharazel, asking them to free [[Havdar]] of the curse that binds him to the [[Medusa Blade]], taken from [[Agata's lair]] and gifted to [[Havdar]] by the party. As the party travels, they send messages to [[Johar]] via sending, and [[Delwath]] keeps an eye on the movements of [[Kadmos]] and company via scrying. 

From brief conversations, they learn that [[Johar]] is alive, and well enough treated, although he has not been allowed to see Samraat [[Nayan Karnas]], apparently because of the Samraat's (perhaps justifiably?) paranoid belief that [[Agata]] is somehow behind [[Sura]]'s reemergence. Not trusting [[Johar]] to be who he says he is, Karnas has summoned a wizard from [[Chardon]] and a mystai of [[Sonkar]] who are both gifted with the power of true sight, who will vouch for [[Johar]] before he can speak with Karnas. From brief visions via scrying, they learn that [[Kadmos]] continues east, towards [[Kharsan]], through the [[Garamjala Desert]].

Half way through the journey, the party arrives south of [[Raven's Hold]], and stops early to scout. Flying above the fort and castle, [[Wellby]] sees no signs of habitation. A mass grave outside the [[Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)|dwarven outpost]] is the only new change since the party was last here, many months ago. Recalling the news from [[Tharn Todor]], the party infers this must been the remains of [[Inakara]] and her kin, the worshippers of mind flayers slain by [[Magran Boulderbeard]] and a company of [[Dwarves]] some months ago. 

The next day, the [[Bahrazel]] answer [[Riswynn]]'s prayers. In her morning prayers, she is briefly transported, seeing a vision of [[Havdar]] in camp, waking and immediately reaching for his sword, when his hands are grasped by those of an old [[Dwarves|dwarf]], and a voice in Dwarven echos, saying, "No. You are free," as the sword turns to a snake and begins to slither away, before shattering to dust. Scrying over the course of the day reveals [[Havdar]] unsettled and deep in thought, and then blaming [[Chardon]] for the curse, advocating for immediate war. This prompts the party to reach out via Sending, apologizing for the party's mistake in gifting him the sword, saying they had no knowledge of its curse, to which [[Havdar]] can only reply: "Shit. Really?" The [[Bahrazel]] also, during the course of the journey, answer some of the parties questions. 

A week after leaving the camp at Lastlight Falls, the party arrives outside the [[Stormcaller Tower]], where [[Hralgar]]'s storm has grown in strength and size, now stretching several miles across the plains. The rain has turned the ground to mud and water pools everywhere. 

![[hralgar-storm-nov-1748.png]]

Between [[Seeker]]'s clairvoyance and [[Kenzo]]'s ability to commune with nature and the land, it is clear that [[Hralgar]] is lost more deeply in his mind than before, and the storm is more intense. The eye that previously left the tower open to the sky is gone, and lightning and thunder echos from the clouds. 

We end as the party contemplates their next move, and whether a journey into the [[Dreamworld]] is necessary to calm [[Hralgar]] and allow them to approach.---

The session begins in the pre-dawn light, as the people of [[Karawa]] prepare to flee west and the party, joined by [[Riswynn]] Brawnanvil, gather their gear and plan their journey north to [[Raven's Hold]]. Amidst the bustle and chaos of hundreds of people packing food, supplies, and what belongings they can carry, the party says their goodbyes and heads north, following the tracks of the gnolls and maw creatures that attacked the night before. 

The tracks lead roughly north, heading overland but relatively near the well-traveled path that connects [[Karawa]] to the ancient trade road running across [[Dunmar]]. As the party follows the trail, the stream of refugees leaving [[Karawa]] in a long line of people, horses, sheep, and other animals can be seen at a distance. A few miles north of the trade road, the tracks converge on an area where the creatures clearly spent some time, perhaps a camp. It seems a larger group was here, and split up, with some heading west, and others heading south to [[Karawa]]. The tracks continue north and east from here, towards [[Raven's Hold]], where it seems the larger group came from. At this point, the party decides to ride straight and fast for [[Raven's Hold]] overland, and gets in a few more hours riding before making camp and spending some time in the evening discussing the approach to [[Raven's Hold]] and looking over [[Riswynn]]’s maps from her great uncle [[Eberk Brawnanvil]].

The next day of travel is an uneventful day of riding across the plains: north of the road the terrain is greener and more rolling steppe than dry, rocky desert, and with the winter rains, much of the grassland is in bloom, covered with bright yellow flowers. However, what would normally be good grazing land is empty of people, and even the animals around are skittish and distant. The following day, the third day of traveling, the party reaches the road. In the distance, a cloud of dust alerts the party to the presence of travelers heading south on the road. Scouting ahead, [[Delwath]] and [[Wellby]] see these are a small group of Dunmari, some on horses and some on foot, traveling with a large herd of goats. The woman in front, [[Shani]], tells the party that they were caught in the north by a large fire, started by lightning from the giant unmoving storm, and were delayed getting to the Festival. A cousin, missing them, rode north to warn them of the attacks south of [[Karawa]] and that plans were to flee west, that all land east of the River [[Hara]] was abandoned to [[Dunmar]]’s enemies. However, this group was caught on the road by a group of gnolls, and lost several horses and many goats, but were able to flee. 

The party decides to head north along the road for some time. Traveling north the rest of the day, the party makes camp off the road, in a surprisingly quiet landscape. No animals moving, hardly even birds or flies. In the middle of the night, they are ambushed by gnolls -- some warriors with spears, others with longbows with nasty barbed arrows. [[Seeker]] groggily tosses the [[Floating Disc Coin|Chardonian coin]], which transforms into a floating platform, and puts a caged rabbit on it; this distracts one of the gnolls, but only briefly, as it bites the rabbit’s head off. The fight is tough as much of the party is caught asleep and unawares, but the party prevails. 

After resting into the morning to recover, [[Seeker]] speaks to a vulture come to feast on the dead gnolls, who, while not the most scintillating conversationalist, does report that little is moving across the plains to the north, and lots of things are moving in the fort. As the party rides north over the next two days, the large storm hovering to the west comes into view: a massive thundercloud, just hanging in the sky, miles across, and not seeming to move. The mountains ahead are now also clearly visible, rising like broken teeth out of the flat plains the party is riding across. The evening of the fifth day of travel, the party camps perhaps 10 miles south of the mountains, a short journey from the pass and from [[Raven's Hold]] to the east. As the sun sets and they set up camp, a whiff of something -- the smell of rotten flesh, burnt flesh, sulfur -- drifts across the plains. Nothing is moving, and the night is silent.

The next morning, the party is surprised to see travelers crossing the plains from the east, heading for the road. A large group, maybe 20 or 30 at least, and traveling fast on horseback. As they approach, it becomes obvious these are not people at all, but [[Centaurs]]. [[Tharandros]], the leader of this band of [[Centaurs]], tells the party that they are moving west, leaving their lands east of here. He tells of disease and poison flowing from a rope that binds the land to another plane, of poisoned water flowing from [[Raven's Hold]] and contaminating more and more land, of [[demons]] that sicken the earth. He tells of how all the infinite imaginings of people exist somewhere in the infinity of the Divine void, and how long ago, in ages long past, humans who preached hellfire and damnation created the [[Abyss]], a realm of chaos and torment and violence, and now the nightmares of people sustain it and places like it. Although [[Tharandros]] is dismissive of [[humans]], and has little concern for the troubles of the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]], he is eventually convinced by [[Delwath]]’s arguments and ultimately by [[Wellby]] to ride south to speak with [[Candrosa]], to warn [[Karawa]] about the possible spreading plague of cursed water, and to learn what he can about the [[Dreamworld]]. 

With that, the party packs up camp, and proceeds up the road for a few hours, eventually stopping just south of the Charmheart’s camp, looking across the mountains rising to the north, and the valley of [[Raven's Hold]] a few miles to the east, and pondering their plan of attack. ---

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1748-11-23): *(late afternoon)* Enter the storm around [[Stormcaller Tower]], chasing a possessed [[Kenzo]]. Dodge animated storm elementals protecting the approach. Reach [[Hralgar]]'s dreamscape, bring [[Hralgar]] back to himself with stories. 

## Narrative

We begin as the party stands outside the swirling storm around [[Stormcaller Tower]], listening to the news the winds bring, while deciding what to do as [[Kenzo]] mediates and communes with the storm, trying to learn more of it. Suddenly, [[Kenzo]] is possessed, his eyes flashing lightning, and he begins to walk into the storm. Having to act quickly, [[Riswynn]] and [[Wellby]] get the animals settled while [[Delwath]] and [[Seeker]] get [[Hralgar's Eyes]] from the [[Portable Hole]], hoping to convince Hraglar-as-[[Kenzo]] to make the storm safe. To no avail, for [[Kenzo]] says that the weather is wonderful and charges ahead. Forced to chase, the party plunges into the storm. Enduring intense lightning strikes and thunderous wind that makes conversation impossible, the party  pushes through the storm, following [[Kenzo]]. 

![[hralgar-storm-nov-1748-2.png]]

Deep into the storm, [[Hralgar]]'s whispers echo in [[Wellby]]'s mind, asking him what he would like to see. Asking for a vision of the place where the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] rests, [[Wellby]] feels a splitting pain in his head and then his vision is carried away, blown east on the wind, seeing a river, farms, irrigation canals in the desert, a castle built into the cliffs, and sitting on the throne of the castle is an [[Orcs|orc]], wearing the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

As [[Kenzo]] picks up the pace, and lightning strikes [[Riswynn]], the party finally makes it to the tower itself, the great cliff of stone that they now know is a crashed airship, [[Vindristjarna]]. [[Kenzo]] is glowing now, lightning flashing from his eyes, as he turns and runs up the path to the tower. He turns angry, shouting 'Go!', as he disappears into the tower itself, a wall of wind and clouds forming behind him. 

Attempting to follow, [[Delwath]] uses the magic of the tanshi to clear some of the fog, revealing storm elementals hiding in wait. Deciding to get past them quickly, the party launches into the air, between [[Wellby]]'s wings and [[Delwath]]'s spells, and briefly harasses the elementals to keep them occupied as the party hurries past in the air. 

Arriving at the tower, the party flies up to the fourth floor, where the statue of Hraglar sits. The storm seems to echo inside the tower, lightning illuminating the walls

![[stormcaller-tower-interior.png]]

Ascending the stairs to the top floor of the tower, the party is not surprised to emerge in a mountaintop domain, giant-sized stairs leading to a massive palace in the distance, as this happened last time as well. Walking down the stairs is a giant, blind, being led by a much smaller person -- [[Kenzo]]. The giant, [[Hralgar]], invites them to come speak and tell tales. [[Kenzo]] seems not to recognize anyone in the party, and says he is the giant Jorundr, a friend and companion of [[Hralgar]]'s. 

Settling in the palace, the party proceeds to tell stories, trying to lead [[Hralgar]] to the idea that he is trapped by telling tales that hint in that direction. After some discussion, during which it is clear that [[Hralgar]] believes it is still during the [[Drankorian Empire]], when a man named [[Akaston]] is Emperor, the party launches into their tales. [[Delwath]] tells of his time trapped in the shadow realm, of the tanshi, the Meswati and how they were freed. [[Hralgar]] seems to see echoes of this future on [[Delwath]], and is confused, as he says [[Delwath]]'s life seems a circle. 

![[hralgar-mountain-palace.png]]

Pausing in thought he turns to [[Wellby]] as he begins to speak who tells a story of a wizard who trapped a prince, building a prison for him that the prince would forget was a prison. The story resonants, but not how [[Wellby]] intended. [[Hralgar]] hears only his own shame and anger in this tale, telling [[Wellby]] that doom is coming, and there are fates worse than dreaming. 

[[Seeker]] then tells the tale of the Heroes of the [[Great War]], how they found a flying castle, had many adventures, and eventually defeated [[Cha'mutte]]. [[Hralgar]] focuses on [[Seeker]] for the first time, sensing something about him, speaking of a phasing stone, the ancient core that powers skyships, and which apparently was the crystallized magic that crashed into the Crystal Mountain in the [[Feywild]] and eventually became [[Seeker]]'s gauntlet. He tells [[Seeker]] if anyone should carry it, it should be a [[Dwarves|dwarf]], and then speaks of the crashed skyship on the plains.

Finally [[Riswynn]] tells her story, the story of her journey to [[Morkalan]] and the people who were trapped there, how the object she bore, the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]], was the key to liberating those trapped from their prison. 

With [[Riswynn]]'s story, and [[Delwath]] commenting on how similar each day was in the shadow realm, and encouragement from the rest of the party, he seems to finally notice the lack of weather here in his dreamscape. Something breaks in him, and he speaks through [[Kenzo]] as lightning flashes from [[Kenzo]]'s eyes and fingers, saying he knows the eyes are here, and to give them to him. As [[Hralgar]] grabs [[Wellby]] lifting high into the air, [[Wellby]] sees what looks like a ghosty, haunted echo of [[Hralgar]] flicking behind him, and [[Hralgar]] agrees to [[Hralgar's Story|tell his story]], seeming to come back to his full memory, realizing that this place is not real and that he has dreamed of [[Kenzo]], and [[Kenzo]] has dreamed of him. And he asks for his eyes again. 

And then [[Kenzo]] opens his eyes, confused, shaken from the possession by [[Hralgar]]'s lucidity, a [[Kenzo's Memories of Hraglar|blur of memories]] coming back to him in a rush, recalling the words of the binding spell that ensnared [[Hralgar]] and how to break it, by reciting the first lines of A Lament for Lost Thunder, an elvish poem by Nelawe. 

As the party rushes down the stairs, they emerge by the statue and attempt to find a way to return the eyes while reciting the poem, but the sounds of thrashing from above quickly make it clear this is the wrong approach. We end as the party rushes back up the stairs, to the sight of the haunted, ghostly version of [[Hralgar]] attempting to strangle the giant in the [[dreamworld]].

## Narrative
We begin as the party rushes into [[Hralgar]]'s dreamscape upon hearing the sounds of [[Hralgar]] struggling, to find a ghostly, angry version of [[Hralgar]] strangling the real [[Hralgar]]. Launching into combat, the party attacks the ghost, [[Wellby]] placing two perfect arrows right through each of the ghost's eyes and [[Delwath]] striking hard with his elven sword. Despite a massive bolt of lightning that briefly knocks [[Riswynn]] down, the party prevails, and as [[Hralgar]]'s ghost is destroyed the dreamscape fades. The party finds themselves in the top floor of [[Stormcaller Tower]], facing the bound and chained giant Hraglar.

His mind now clear, he recognizes the party and tells them he can hold off the madness for a few hours, if they wish to flee again. Showing him the eyes, the party tells him they are here to save him, as promised. [[Riswynn]] uses her mending magic to repair the eyes, and as the damage and cracks from the years and the journey are repaired, each eye magically melds with [[Hralgar]], restoring his vision. 

The iron chains, however, seem a tougher nut to crack, until [[Kenzo]] recalls his memory of the binding from when he was possessed, recalling that the the first words of the elven poem A Lament for Lost Thunder can break the chains and end the enchantment. Unfortunately, the party sold the book containing this poem in [[Darba]], and can't quite recall the words correctly. However, a quick Sending to [[Govir]] has him promising to find a copy in the next couple of hours, when [[Delwath]] will scry him to see the writing and translate the words. 

At this point, the party takes a breather, [[Delwath]] cooking some food while [[Hralgar]] talks about [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]. He tells them about the end of the golden age of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], when the [[Helea]] was assassinated by the [[Omnis Pura]], a group that believed in [[Humans|human]] supremacy, and especially supremacy of those who inhabited [[Hkar]], the land where [[Humans]] were created, the longest. [[Apollyon|Apollyon]], [[Hralgar]] says, was connected to this group, but he was captured during [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s reign and doesn't know how it ended, not really. 

[[Kenzo]] then listens to [[Jorundr's Story]], recording it for the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]].

Over the next hour, the party gathers what they can from the tower, focusing on the few books left in the library from their last adventure, and the cleaning stone from [[Eudomes]]' room. Then, it is time to scry [[Govir]], and read the words of A Lament for Lost Thunder through his eyes. As [[Kenzo]] speaks the words, the chains binding [[Hralgar]] shatter and turn to dust. 

The storm grows more intense and violent, and [[Hralgar]] warns the party to run, as he turns to lightning and thunder and sweeps out of the tower. An incredibly loud burst of thunder shakes the foundations of the tower, and then [[Hralgar]] is there, pulling a giant sword of lightning out of thin air, his eyes flashing as he strikes the tower, the statue, everything about this place over and over. Even once the tower is reduced to rubble and the bust of himself that imprisoned him to dust, he lifts his massive feet and stomps, sending waves of thunder through the destruction. And then, [[Hralgar]] thanks the party, asking what he can do for them. 

![[stormcaller-after-storm.png]]

The party asks about [[Vindristjarna]], also known as the The Star on the Wind, the skyship upon which [[Stormcaller Tower]] was built. [[Hralgar]] tells them the phasing stone, the magic that powers skyships, was destroyed, but he sends the storm north. The clouds blow away, the thunder and rain stops, and a beautiful sunset emerges on the wet plains. [[Hralgar]] opens his eyes, and tells the party that there is still a phasing stone in his home in the mountains, less than a hundred miles north, that they are welcome to find and claim for themselves.

He then digs out the skyship and gives the party a tour. While much is damaged, when cleared and excavated, it looks like nothing more than a truly massive sailing ship made of stone.

With this task done, [[Hralgar]] goes to hunt and say goodbye to his physical form, joined for part of his journey by [[Delwath]]. As the sun sinks below the horizon, he returns with a brace of antelope. As [[Hralgar]] and the party begin to speak of [[Apollyon|Apollyon]], of his sometimes-ally, perhaps turned enemy [[Cha'mutte]], of the perfectly circular island where [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] traveled, somewhere southwest of [[Drankor]] and shielded from storms, the smell of roasting anelope wafts over the camp. We end the session as [[Hralgar]] and the party share a late dinner, planning to resume their conversation this evening, before [[Hralgar]] vanishes to merge with the storm and learn the tales of the snow and storms and wind and rain.

## Narrative
We begin at camp, as [[Hralgar]] returns from hunting with a brace of antelope and [[Delwath]] begins to cook a late dinner. [[Hralgar]] and the party talk, and [[Dunmar Fellowship]] hears [[Hralgar]]'s story and learned a little of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], about the skyship [[Vindristjarna]], about [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] and the [[Omnis Pura]], and about volcanoes and how to destroy powerful magic. 

[[Hralgar]] spent his younger days uninterested in the doings of [[Humans]], paying little attention to them on the plains below, during the Golden Age of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]. Visitors came, and went - [[Dwarves]], [[Stoneborn]], [[Humans]] - and they spoke of ancient magic, of myths and stories. When the Golden Age ended in civil war, and the [[Omnis Pura]] came to power, things became more difficult, and some time later he was trapped by [[Eudomes]], during [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s reign. [[Hralgar]] knew of [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] as a powerful wizard, an artificer of great skill who wielded the magic of command. His lair, on a circular island south and west of [[Drankor]] in the [[Sea of Storms]], was shielded and could not be approached even by power storm giants traveling as the wind. 

[[Hralgar]] also spoke of the skyship [[Vindristjarna]], and the [[Phasing Stones]] that once powered the great kingdoms of the giants. Their power is weakened now, but there is still enough magic left that they could be used to make [[Vindristjarna]] fly again. [[Hralgar]] once had one in his palace in the mountains, which he invites the party to take, although he warns them that it has been a millennium since he was last there, and who knows what might inhabit it now.  Should they find it, on the lower floor that was once his library is a great pillar that will reveal runes describing the construction and repair of skyships when lightning magic is channeled into it. He also tells the party of a little book that contains his notes and research on the history of [[Vindristjarna]]. 

Finally, he describes places in the Taelgar he knows of that contain volcanoes, some of which may retain lingering connections to the [[elemental Plane of Fire]]: far to the north, stretching west to east across the central mountains; continuing to the northern coast of [[Green Sea]] and the island that the [[Humans]] called [[Irrla]]; and also the islands in the [[Nevos Sea]]. [[Hralgar]] mentions that the fire giants may know more: they once lived in the mountains east of here, but whether any linger now he does not know. 

In the morning, [[Dunmar Fellowship]] prepares to bid farwell to [[Hralgar]]. He bids a fond farewell to the party, thanking them, and gifting [[Kenzo]] a fragment of storm giant ki before vanishing. As he turns into the winds and departs, he also gives the party a wind blessing, allowing them to turn to clouds and travel on the wind until sunset. Before departing for the mountains, the party [[Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum Viision|looks at]] The [[Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum]] in [[Eudomes]]' Mirror.

Flying fast on the wind, the party reaches in the mountains and [[Hralgar]]'s palace in only a few hours. 

![[mountains.png]]

Scouting as wisps of clouds, the party sees [[Hralgar]]'s palace, looking much as it did in the dream world, but ruined, with the roof gone, as well as the upper stories. A structure of ice filled with elaborate ice sculptures sits at the back of the main floor, and shadows billow up from the lower level. Pacing back and forth is a woman, maybe 10 feet tall and seemingly made or coated in ice, jagged shards clinging to her and forming something like a crown. 

![[ice-palace.png]]

The party decides to negotiate, with [[Delwath]] approaching to speak while [[Wellby]] and [[Kenzo]] invisibly sneak to hide behind ice pillars, and [[Riswynn]] and [[Seeker]] linger invisibly (but noisily) at the top of the stairs. The ice maiden speaks with [[Delwath]], who asks about the shadows below. The woman seems not to care if they wish to venture there, telling [[Delwath]] should he wish to journey into the nightmares of Kurome, it is no concern of hers. When asked about the phasing stone, her patience grows thin, and she tells [[Delwath]] that he is welcome to seek it in Kurome's realm, but to go quickly either way, for there are foolish travelers to freeze in the wastes and her attention cannot long linger here. 

![[ice-spirit-portrait.png|500]]

At that, [[Wellby]] looses an arrow, and battle is joined. [[Wellby]] and [[Kenzo]] have been sufficiently silent - and invisible - that they get the jump on everyone, and [[Wellby]]'s arrow bursts into flame as it strikes true. The ice maiden is caught off guard as [[Kenzo]] lunges to attack as well, using his fist of planar power to push her across the ice. Staggering, [[Delwath]] strikes her down with his sword and magic, only for her icy crystal heart to rise up and attack with blasts of cold. The air around her becomes bone-chilling, and those close to her begin to freeze. As [[Seeker]] hits her with a psychic blast - turned to fire by his glove - and [[Riswynn]] with a blast of sacred fire, the icy heart staggers. A whirling storm of obscuring, blowing snow rises around her, and more blasts of cold shoot at the party, nearly killing [[Kenzo]] except for the blessing of the dwarven gods provided by [[Riswynn]], which keeps him from falling unconscious. Finally, [[Delwath]] cracks the icy heart with bolts of pure magic. 

As silence falls, the wounded party gathers around as [[Delwath]] makes a fire and a warming meal and the group rests as the session ends.

### Timeline
- (DR:: 1748-11-24), afternoon: Venture to the library, and find their way to the [[dreamworld]], where they encounter the tricks of Kurome. Recover the phasing stone, returning to a dream version of the real world. Wake themselves up before freezing to death. Record information from [[Hralgar]]'s library about skyships. Depart to return to the crash of [[Vindristjarna]] at dusk, with [[Hralgar]]'s wind blessing.

## Narrative
We begin as the party finishes a short rest, warmed by [[Delwath]]'s hot drinks. During the rest, visions of the cold thoughts and memories of the ice maiden, recently killed, haunt the visions of the party.

*The wind blows harshly, the gusts carrying swirling bits of ice and snow, the shattered remains of the ice maiden's heart, carrying her memories of winters past.*

*You see light snow blowing around a man walking alone, struggling to climb the sloping road - track, really - zigzagging up the side of the mountains towards the high pass. His horse is favoring her left side, and the man walks at her side. Although dressed in a heavy cloak and warm boots, he shivers occasionally, looking up at the mountains. The weather is not a serious threat to him, not yet, but as you begin to blow on the ice in your hand, it crackles, hissing and spattering, and the air begins to freeze. A gentle breath and a wave, and the frozen air drifts, growing and gathering into a stormcloud, then a blizzard. The traveler looks with dismay as the weather turns, the snow picking up, visibility dropping. Soon his body will be frozen on the road, and the slithering shadows below will have their fill of his last dreams of despair before his peaceful slide to a never ending sleep. 

*Another memory, another image of a traveler, freezing in the mountains. Again, and again, the years drifting back, until the crackle of the fire shakes you awake, and you look around at your companions, glad to see living flesh and blood and not frozen corpses.*

As the rest ends, [[Seeker]] has wandered off from the fire, and is enjoying a meal of the remnants of magical ice that linger where the ice maiden was destroyed. The manages to quickly get everyone oriented, however, and heads into the darkness of the library, where even the powerful daylight of the driftglobes sheds only a weak, dim light. 

In the library, the party does not find the phasing stone, but does find a strange doorway that shifts appearance based on whomever looks at it. When [[Delwath]]'s moth scout enters but does not return, the party ventures into the doorway, which opens into a long hallway that seems to continue endlessly in both directions. 

![[nightmare-maze-corridor.png]]

The corridor leads to an empty throne room, with an empty small side chamber next to it. As the party begins to better understand this place and realize they can attempt to shape it with their thoughts and wishes, a silver bowl of shaved ice appears that [[Seeker]] tries to eat. The party experiments a bit with keeping [[Seeker]] from the ice, and then decides to try to clear their minds.

[[Kenzo]] leads the group in meditation, and one by one the party clears their minds, except for [[Seeker]], who is having trouble focusing on emptiness. The throne room vanishes, the ice melts, and all that is left is an empty expanse with small pools of silver water. A clockwork cat approaches one of the pools, and begins to drink. The mechanical cat approaches [[Seeker]], and falls into a pile of gears at his touch; as the cat collapses, a wind picks up, cold with the taste of ice. A giant hand emerges from the ground, pointing in the direction of the wind.

[[Seeker]], along with the heroic [[Ladder]] now sporting a dozen or more medals of honor, leaps to head in that direction, and the party follows. As the wind grows more intense, flashes of imagines can be seen, people struggling against snow and ice, freezing slowly until a round pulsating stone, the phasing stone, falls out of one of their hands. 

![[phasing-stone.png]]

The party dives through the floor into an empty space, in which the phasing stone floats. 

![[nightmare-empty.png]]

After a few failed attempts to capture it, the party realizes that working together is the only way to outdream [[Kurome]]. [[Seeker]] dreams a storm of hail and snow pelting the stone, which bursts into flame; [[Delwath]] dreams a giant hunting bird of water, dowsing the stone, which turns to ice; [[Riswynn]] then dreams a wall of fire scorching the ice, and [[Kenzo]] adds a lightning storm with flying boulders crushing it. The stone turns to solid volcanic rock, and falls through the water bird, into [[Wellby]]'s dreaming: the [[Portable Hole]]. 

With that, the party seems to be awake in the library. Using the [[Dream Mirror]], they realize that they are still dreaming, but quickly find their freezing bodies at the campsite, and wake themselves up. After another round of warming drinks, the party spends the last few hours of the afternoon copying notes and finding books in [[Hralgar]]'s library before returning to the crashed airship via cloud travel at dusk.

*in which the party repairs the skyship [[Vindristjarna]]
[[Kenzo]], [[Wellby]], [[Seeker]], [[Delwath]], and [[Riswynn]] camp at the ruins of [[Vindristjarna]], working to repair the control mechanisms that let it fly. 
Start: evening, Nov 24th 1748
End: night, Nov 29th 1748



## Narrative
We begin at dusk, at site of the crashed [[Vindristjarna|airship]], as the party settles in for the night and begins to determine what is necessary to repair [[Vindristjarna]]. From the notes and information gleaned in [[Hralgar]]'s library, [[Seeker]], [[Riswynn]], and [[Delwath]] are able to determine that three steps are necessary to repair the ship: the construction of an adamantine harness for the phasing stone; the construction of stone console to hold the phasing stone apparatus; and the construction of a gold and silver focus to channel the energy. 

![[vindristjarna-crash-location.png]]

Over the next two days, [[Seeker]] and [[Riswynn]] work to construct the adamantine harness and the stone console to mount the phasing stone to, guided by [[Riswynn]]'s magic and the knowledge of both the [[Dwarves]]. During these days of work, [[Wellby]] and [[Kenzo]] tend the camp and keep watch, and Delawth scrys, seeing [[Kadmos]] and company marching in the desert to the south, in the heart of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]]. 

On the third day, November 27th, [[Riswynn]] and [[Seeker]] construct considerable quantities of gold and silver thread with [[Riswynn]]'s magic, to shape and forge the final piece of the control apparatus for [[Vindristjarna]]. [[Wellby]], however, sees a rider on the horizon, and heads to scout, finding [[Alesh]] riding towards the former site of the [[Stormcaller Tower]].

![[alesh-portrait.png]]

From [[Alesh]], the party gets news about [[Dunmar]]. She is riding from [[Karawa]] to [[Sura]]'s camp, and stopped to investigate the weird lack of a storm near [[Stormcaller Tower]], called the Tower of the Wild Wind by the Dunmari. Among bits of personal gossip and historical trivia, the party learns that a band of [[Orcs]] (the [[Dustthorn Horde]], the remnants of [[Agata]]'s allies) attacked the border near [[Karawa]], desperate for food. Several were captured and told their interrogators that [[Agata]] was behind Karnas' ascension to the throne, and he was working for her. 

[[Alesh]] also reported that [[Cintra]] has been consumed with dreams, and says that [[Shakun]] told her: "My aunts and uncles are playing a dangerous game. That the armies of [[Nayan Karnas|Karnas]] and [[Sura]] must meet, but not in battle, or the silence will spread and [[Dunmar]] will be no more." Few know quite what to make of this, but at least in [[Karawa]] it is still believed the greater danger is from the East. Wanting to convince [[Sura]] to march her armies East to be ready to meet [[Grash]] if needed, the party writes a letter to [[Sura]] and gives [[Alesh]] the letter and a Sending Stone to deliver, as she departs. 

Meanwhile, [[Seeker]] and [[Riswynn]] convert 800 gold and 800 silver coins into several pounds of metal wire, and begin to construct the phasing stone apparatus, using a perfect emerald from [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]'s Hoard as a gemstone focus. As the day progresses, [[Riswynn]] also speaks via Sending with Ulfgar, in [[Chardon]], and [[Govir]], in [[Tokra]], both of whom agree to research what they can about [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] and his magical artifacts, and will be available for scrying to read notes at sunset in a week's time. 

The next day, [[Seeker]] and [[Riswynn]] continue to work on the channeling device, while [[Delwath]] scries [[Kharsan]] and sees [[Grash]]'s army leaving. 

![[undead-orcs-marching.png]]

That evening, the night of Nov 28th, [[Seeker]] has a dream, a shadow hunter threatening that he is coming soon for them. 

The next day, Nov 29th, is spent finishing the work on [[Vindristjarna]]. By evening, the ship is ready for flight, and [[Seeker]] attunes to the phasing stone and begins to practice flying. 

The session ends around midnight, as the party is awakened by the howls of hunting dogs, lead by the shadow hunter from [[Seeker]]'s dreams.

- (DR:: 1748-12-04), dawn: See the edge of the [[Orcs|orcs]] territory from the air, maybe 40-50 miles distant, in the early morning light.

## Narrative
The session begins as the party is awakened by the howls of shadow dogs, the same chalyte zombie assassins created by [[Fausto]] that chased [[Kenzo]], [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and [[Delwath]] down on the flight from [[Chardon]]. 

![[shadow-hunter-portrait.png|300]]![[shadow-hunter-wolf.png|300]]

While [[Delwath]] peels off to fight a flying shadow demon, and [[Seeker]] begins to steer the skyship towards the fight, the rest of the party engages. [[Kenzo]] attacks the lead assassin, while [[Riswynn]] summons a sunbeam to blast away the shadows and [[Wellby]] takes careful aim at everything he can see. But the shadow dogs vanish into the darkness, even as [[Seeker]] animates the [[Ladder]] to stand guard, and emerge, surrounding [[Seeker]], on the deck of the ship. Under heavy attack, [[Seeker]] polymorphs himself into a giant ape-like yeti, while [[Kenzo]] is brought down by a blast of necrotic energy from the assassin, who, leaving the dogs to distract the party, begins to flee with [[Kenzo]]. For a moment it looks like things will be okay, with [[Riswynn]] healing [[Kenzo]], but then [[Riswynn]] is driven off by the shadow assassin's fear spell, [[Kenzo]] is knocked out again, and it is only [[Wellby]]'s perfect shot that brings down the shadow assassin before he can escape with [[Kenzo]]'s unconscious body. The shadow assassin turns, in death, to a normal, if ragged looking [[Humans|human]] man, a pallid, haunted look on his face in death. As the rest of the party cleans up the shadow dogs, [[Wellby]] tends to [[Kenzo]]'s wounds, stabilizing him. 

The next morning, the party prepares for the journey east while [[Seeker]] continues to practice with [[Vindristjarna]]. The day passes uneventfully after the chaos of the night before; [[Delwath]] hunts and preserves some antelope for the trip, and [[Riswynn]] continues to clear rubble from the deck of the ship. Deciding that having two people able to control [[Vindristjarna]] would speed the journey, the party plans on taking the next day for [[Kenzo]] to learn the workings of the phasing stone, before heading east.

Around lunchtime the next day, December 1st, [[Kenzo]]'s practice is interrupted by [[Sura]]'s voice coming from the Sending Stone. [[Sura]] tells the party that, while she appreciates the warnings of danger to the east, she cannot march her army across the plains while leaving [[Tokra]] unwatched in her rear, especially not with a small force of Chardonian mages still camped outside the city. [[Sura]] says that they plan to ride for [[Tokra]], to claim the city and expel the Chardonians. [[Sura]] tells them that in about 20 days, is the [[Day of Atonement]], [[Sonkar]]'s Day, which begins the most holy month of the year, and she will not wage war then, and neither will the Samraat [[Nayan Karnas]]. So [[Tokra]] must be taken soon, or not at all. 

There is some debate, about whether the better course of action is to march her army east, now, to defend the borders should the party fail, or whether to take [[Tokra]] as planned first, to secure her position before [[Grash]] marches west, should he succeed in acquiring the [[Cloak of Rainbows]].

Wanting the guidance of the gods, the next morning, before the party heads east, [[Riswynn]] prays and asks the [[Bahrazel]] for insight. Although the gods often speak in riddles, the message [[Riswynn]] hears is one of fortification, of strength, that buildings with strong foundations last longer than those with weak roots. Eventually the party agrees this is probably guiding them to leave [[Sura]] to strengthen her position, that she will be better prepared for [[Grash]], if needed, with a solid foundation in the central plains. [[Kenzo]] also meditates, and feels the strength of [[Dunmar]] as a solid core that maintains [[Shakun]]'s Protection, and that if the center were lost the protection would fall anyway. But again, no clear, obvious right course of action. 

Speaking to [[Sura]] one final time, [[Kenzo]] argues the most important thing is to be united, and if [[Sura]] believes that taking [[Tokra]] is what must happen for an army to be ready to face [[Grash]] should he turn west, the party will not argue against that. [[Kenzo]] agrees to send a letter to the Lakan monks, reporting on all that has happened. As he finishes, a spirit steps from [[Delwath]]'s shield, a lynx, and takes the letter, before racing at speed across the plains for [[Tokra]]. 

Over the next two days, the party falls into a routine. [[Seeker]] pilots the ship for 11 hours, often taking [[Vindristjarna]] as high as it can go, into the freezing clouds far, far above the desert, often removing his shirt to feel the cold wind on his bare skin. Then, the ship lands for an hour, for [[Kenzo]] to attune to the phasing stone, and [[Seeker]] rests while [[Kenzo]] flies through the night. The cycle then repeats, allowing the party to travel 220 miles per day. 

![[over-the-desert.png|800]]

On the morning of Dec 4th, the party spies a fertile green crescent along the edge of banks of a river, cattle grazing, and orderly wheat fields watched over by a colorful guard tower on the banks of the river. We end, in the pre-dawn light, as the party considers their course of action, maybe 50 miles from the homeland of the [[Orcs|orcs]] they have come to find.

# Dunmari Frontier - Session 76

>[!info] The People of the Rainbow: in which the party navigates orcish diplomacy in Xurkhaz
> *Featuring: [[Seeker]], [[Delwath]], [[Kenzo]], [[Wellby]], [[Riswynn]]*
> *In Taelgar: Dec 04, 1748 DR to Dec 05, 1748 DR*
> *On Earth: Sunday May 07, 2023*
> *[[Xurkhaz]]*

The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] engages in cautious diplomacy with orcish leaders in [[Xurkhaz]], discussing mutual threats and the significance of a [[Cloak of Rainbows|magical cloak]].

## Session Info
### Summary
- The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] scouts the orcish kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]] from their airship, observing its rural landscape and military preparations.
- Initial contact with the orcs at a western fort is tense, with the party being shot at but eventually leading to a dialogue with Commander Vorgaz.
- The party discusses their past and shares knowledge of Grash with Vorgaz, who agrees to send a message to Chief Lubash.
- Upon arrival in Uzgukhar, the party is received by Chief Lubash and advisors; they discuss the threat of Apollyon and the significance of a magical cloak.
- The party considers the risk of Chardonian spies and the theft of the cloak, but Lubash is reluctant to flee, highlighting the cloak's importance in orc society.

### Timeline
- (DR:: 1748-12-04): Overfly kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]], scouting. Speak with [[Vorgaz]], commander of a fort on the western border, then fly through the night to [[Uzgukhar]], the capital. Scry on [[Govir]] and Ulfgar to gather their research on the way. 
- (DR:: 1748-12-05): Arrive at [[Uzgukhar]] early in the morning. Land, leaving [[Seeker]] in charge of [[Vindristjarna]]. Wait for hours for an audience with the Chief. Speak with Chief [[Lubash]] and his advisors. 

## Narrative
We begin high above the orcish kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]] (zurk - kaz), as the party scouts and debates what to do. The territory is large - at least 150 miles across, nestled between two rivers on its eastern and western borders. From the air, it appears mostly rural, with only a few forts and towers defending the western border, and one major city near the confluence of the two border rivers. This is a dry, arid land of rolling hills, sustained by heavy irrigation that supports what appears to be mostly wheat and cattle farming. 

Drifting over the landscape, the party flies towards the fortification on the western border, a small walled town and fort. As they approach, it is apparent a large army is camped here, maybe 1500 [[Orcs]] spread out along the river, prepared for war. The [[Orcs]] who spot [[Vindristjarna]] are immediately on alert, and initial negotiations proceed under a hail of arrows striking the bottom of the ship. It is apparent the [[Orcs]] are wary of outsiders, especially because sometime in the recent past it seems a group of Chardonians infiltrated [[Xurkhaz]] with nefarious motives. But the commander is swayed by the party's apparent dislike of Chardonians, and he invites them to descend and speak. After a brief negotiation about leaving their weapons behind, the party is led through a brightly colored courtyard to an inner chamber in the fort, where Commander [[Vorgaz]] introduces himself. 

The conversation gets off to a rough start, with the party questioning [[Vorgaz]] about what he knows, and the commander being unwilling to answer. But eventually the party tells [[Vorgaz]] what they know about [[Grash]], and something of their history together, how they came to adventure as a group, and this convinces him to be a little more forthcoming. However, he is still a little wary, as apparently he was too trusting of the Chardonian infiltrators earlier, and does not want to make the same mistake twice. But, he is convinced to send a fast messenger to Chief [[Lubash]] in [[Uzgukhar]], warning him the party is coming and urging him to speak with them. 

As the party prepares to depart, [[Riswynn]] magically crafts some weapons, and blesses [[Vorgaz]]'s sword to aid him in battle. During the flight east to Uzgukar, the party scries on [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]], seeing a [[Vision of Ulfgar's research]], and also on [[Govir]], seeing a [[Vision of Govir's research]]. 

The next morning, the sun rises over the city of Uzgukar. It is not a huge place, more like a walled town than a proper city, unlikely to house more than 1,000 people, but beautiful from the air, decorated in bright colors.  The party is expected, and they descend, leaving [[Seeker]] control [[Vindristjarna]]. They are met at the gates of the city by a guard, and brought to the palace, where they wait. Several hours later, they are taken to see Chief [[Lubash]] and his advisors. 

The Chief is sitting with his advisors in the throne room of the palace, decorated with colorful rainbow motifs. As the party approaches, they feel the gods fall silent, and Chief [[Lubash]] is wearing a rainbow cloak. With him are two advisors: General [[Murook]], a woman in chain mail, and Loremaster [[Azogar]], and older man in colorful robes. The [[Orcs]] are initially somewhat dismissive, unsure what the party has to offer or what information they can provide, but at [[Wellby]]'s prompting, the Loremaster does tell some of the [[Story of Xurkhaz]], although the Chief stops him from sharing everything.

The conversation turns to [[Grash]], and although [[Lubash]] is initially dismissive of the threat, the news that [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] is returned and behind this attack gives him pause. The party shares nearly the entire story, leaving out only the details of the scepter and of [[Rai]]'s involvement, which convinces [[Lubash]] of the truth of their information. He says that while [[Cha'mutte]] saved them from [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] once before, [[Cha'mutte]] is gone. [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] drove their ancestors into the wilderness long ago, and the memory of the danger he represents remains. This news seems to shake him.

The conversation turns to the cloak itself, and its role in their society. At [[Lubash]]'s orders, General [[Murook]] tells [[Murook's Story|her story]], which makes clear that while the cloak is not necessary to maintain the society of [[Xurkhaz]], it is very important to them. It is the only known magic that can free [[Orcs]] bound to [[Thark]] from that bondage, and it helps freed [[Orcs]] fight the voices of [[Thark]] that still echo in their heads after they are freed. 

The conversation wraps up with discussion of the Chardonians: the group that inflitrated the [[Orcs]] a few months ago, disguised by arcane magic, and then the possiblity of [[Kadmos]] scrying or teleporting in to steal the cloak. Although not completely certain of the best course of action, the party broaches the idea of fleeing with the cloak, to keep it safe from [[Grash]] and [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]. But [[Lubash]] is unwilling to consider this, as apparently it takes years and years of effort to shield an area from [[Thark]]'s eyes, and keep the [[People of the Rainbow]] safe from being hunted by chained [[Orcs]]. Fleeing would expose them to attacks from chained [[Orcs]], again. 

We end as [[Lubash]] turns to other business, the conversation turning to planning. Is anything they can do to stop this threat of teleportation that they have raised as a possibility? Would [[Lubash]] shift his command center to the skyship? Should the party stay to guard [[Lubash]] against a covert assassination attempt, or try to seek out [[Kadmos]] directly?

## Narrative
We begin as the party returns to the skyship [[Vindristjarna]], to discuss and plan while awaiting the arrival of Loremaster [[Azogar]] and General [[Murook]], who are expecting a tour of the ship. After some discussion of the events of earlier in the day, and the magic of the [[Cloak of Rainbows]], conversation stops as the orcish visitors arrive. 

Loremaster [[Azogar]] is very curious about the magic of the skyship, and quickly catches [[Seeker]]'s attention with his questioning. [[Seeker]] explains about the phasing stone, holding little back, as the conversation drifts among topics, touching on the origin of the phasing stone, the [[Feywild]] and its connection to cloak, and the idea of crystallized magic connecting to many different planes. [[Azogar]] speaks of the various rumors and tales he has collected, from the time before the founding of [[Xurkhaz]], when the [[Orcs]] wandered widely, hiding where they could from [[Thark]]'s raiders. In particular, a tale of a hero of his people, who used the crystalized magic of the [[elemental plane of water]] to create fog that hid his tribe for years. During the conversation, [[Murook]] asks about the tactical uses of the skyship, as well, and quizzes the party on exactly what happens to the dead, reanimated [[Orcs]]. 

[[Murook]] and [[Azogar]] depart, reminding the party they are due at the palace for dinner shortly, and leave the party to plan. During this time, the party discusses options, and [[Delwath]] scries on [[Hektor]], seeing [[Kadmos]] and his companions hunched over a map or piece of paper, discussing in low voices, seeming separated for the moment from the main army of [[Grash]]'s forces. 

At dinner, Chief [[Lubash]] seems more open, talking more freely. He explains the nature of the cloak's protection: within the borders of [[Xurkhaz]], [[Thark]]'s voice cannot be heard. [[Orcs]] bound to [[Thark]] will suddenly have that connection severed, and few will be able to fight effectively after that happens. But, he does not know if the undead [[Orcs]] raised by [[Grash]] remain connected to [[Thark]]: if they do, he does not fear them, but if they don't, then they would not be affected by the cloak's magic. This protection has taken years to create, and maintain, pacing the borders of the country, which is a large part of the [[Orcs|orc]]'s reluctance to abandon [[Xurkhaz]], even though they have refuges prepared in the broken hills to the east. 

The party also learns some more history of the cloak. It was created by the [[Cloudspinner]], the Lady of Sunsets, the archfey ruler of the fey domain of [[Amberglow]], now gone, her domain abandoned. With her missing, the cloak is irreplaceable. 

Finally, they learn something of the previous Chardonian party that came to [[Xurkhaz]]. There were four of them: two warriors, twin brothers, named [[Valius]] and [[Vargus]], a spellcaster named [[Evelina]], and a trickster rogue named Roman. They came in two groups: [[Valius]], [[Vargus]], and [[Evelina]] pretending to be scholars seeking to open trade ties and knowledge exchange between [[Chardon]] and [[Xurkhaz]], and Roman, disguised by illusion magic as an [[Orcs|orc]] wanderer. They lived in the palace for a month or more, learning about the cloak and the [[Orcs]], but were eventually found out when Roman slipped up and was seen talking to the Chardonians while not under his illusion spell. Roman was killed, and the others fled east, taking some time, more than a month, to reconnect with [[Kadmos]]. 

Conversation turns to planning and strategy for [[Kadmos]]' inevitable attack on the palace. After considering several plans, it is eventually agreed that the party will pretend to have a falling out with Chief [[Lubash]], who will pretend to expel them from his kingdom. In reality, they will hide, hoping to set a trap for [[Kadmos]] and company. 

During this time, [[Delwath]]'s messenger lynx returns, bearing a letter for [[Kenzo]] from the Lakan Monks: [[Lakan Monk Letter]].

Finally, after exploring the palace and beginning to make some plans, the party returns to [[Lubash]]'s throne room, and summons the [[Orcs|orc]] trapped in the mirror to speak. She is confused, but is apparently an [[Orcs|orc]] of [[Xurkhaz]], from 60 years ago, who was caught by [[Agata]] and interrogated, with the hope that she would reveal some of the secrets of the cloak to [[Agata]]. She is freed, released from the mirror into [[Lubash]]'s care, as the session ends.

### Timeline
- (DR::1748-12-06): Spend the day in [[Uzgukhar]], trying to play-act a fight with Chief [[Lubash]]; depart in fake disgrace; sneak back into palace under cover of darkness to wait. No attack comes during the fitful night.

- (DR:: 1748-12-08): [[Kadmos]] and company attack in the early morning hours, well before dawn, and are defeated. 

## Narrative
We begin as the day of deception passes, Dec 6th, during which the party tries to fool anyone scrying, convincing watchers that they have attempted to steal the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] from Chief [[Lubash]]. The day passes in fits and starts, until the party departs in false disgrace in the late afternoon. Camping in the desert, the party scries [[Hektor]], seeing him on a boat on the river, an uncertain distance away. After preparing for a battle with Hero's Feast, and sneaking back into the palace, the party passes a fitful night waiting for an attack that does not come.

The next morning, Dec 7th, the party stays hidden in the palace, waiting. [[Lubash]] brings bad news: the western border was attacked, with huge loss of life, and the fortress at Khumarz cannot hold back another assault of undead. The day passes. Two [[Orcs|orc]] warriors from the western front arrive, to provide more support for the coming battle with [[Kadmos]]. Day turns to night, as the party waits, tense.

Past midnight -- early in the morning on Dec 8th -- the attack begins with an undead assault on the city gates. While the palace guards rush off to protect the townsfolk, the party prepares for [[Kadmos]]' assault on [[Lubash]] and attempt to steal the cloak. Hiding in the bedrooms, the party waits until [[Delwath]]'s alarm is triggered, and launches their attack. [[Delwath]]'s sickening radiance keeps the vanguard of [[Kadmos]]' crew at bay for a moment, although [[Wellby]] takes the brunt of ranged attacks, as he is initially the only easy target. As the fight proceeds, [[Kenzo]] pins down the large demonic creature commanded by [[Kadmos]] with his frightening strike, but [[Casian]] and [[Kadmos]] manage to dimension door into the room with [[Lubash]], and make a grab for the cloak, stopped only by [[Seeker]] dimension dooring away with [[Lubash]]. [[Hektor]] manages to barrel through the door and grab [[Lubash]] and the cloak, only to be stopped by [[Seeker]]'s irresistible curiosity spell, trapping him in [[Delwath]]'s sickening radiance with [[Lubash]], who nearly dies from the spell. Still, even with the large warriors ([[Hektor]] and the demon) neutralized, [[Antonia]], [[Kadmos]], and [[Casian]] made to get away with the cloak, until [[Antonia]] was stopped by [[Riswynn]]'s wall of fire. Still, [[Casian]] and [[Kadmos]] nearly get away, stopped only by a clutch counterspell from [[Delwath]], stopping [[Casian]]'s final dimension door. 

With everyone barely alive, [[Delwath]] uses sleep to bring the enemies unconscious. The session ends as [[Kadmos]] is executed and the remaining prisoners are stripped of their gear and trapped in the mirror.

## Narrative
We begin as the battle ends, and the party collects and sorts through the gear from [[Kadmos]] and company. [[Kadmos]], and the sorcerer [[Evelina]], lie dead on the ground: [[Evelina]] killed in battle, [[Kadmos]] executed afterward. The remainder of the enemies are trapped in the mirror, after having been put to sleep by [[Delwath]]'s magic. After tending to [[Lubash]], [[Riswynn]] turns to [[Seeker]] to try to remove whatever icy curse clings to him, despite [[Seeker]]'s insistence he is fine. However, normal restoration magic does not seem remove the curse - instead, it just makes it briefly visible, as a small icy flying gargoyle-like creature clinging to [[Seeker]]'s back. Something of ice is needed to drag the curse away from [[Seeker]]. [[Delwath]] attempts to banish it with his sword, but as it is fey, not a fiend, this has no effect. Deciding this is a problem for the morning, the party rests, planning to interrogate the prisoners in the morning.

The next morning, the party has a late breakfast with [[Lubash]], [[Murook]], and [[Azogar]]. They report the recent news, that [[Grash]] has begun slaughtering his army, seeking to turn them into undead. There is some discussion of the metaphysics of this situation, and whether the undead are still bound by [[Thark]] and thus unable to enter [[Xurkhaz]], but ultimately it seems the risen [[Orcs|orc]] zombies are a more serious threat than [[Lubash]] anticipated. Several options, including protecting the city from undead with [[Riswynn]]'s magic while those who can flee, are discussed.

The party then interrogates the prisoners, starting with [[Valius]], the archer twin. After his cell is combined with [[Vargus]]', his twin brother, [[Valius]] begins to speak in response to [[Delwath]]'s patient questions. He speaks of how he and his brother were mercenaries after they left the [[Chardonian Legion]], traveling around, searching for a rumored lost dragon treasure in the mountains on the border of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], that kind of thing. But they were always more inclined to drink and eat and talk at pubs than actually find treasure, and eventually broke they ended up back in [[Chardon]], signing up to hunt for treasure for the [[Society of the Open Scroll]]. After a few successful trips, [[Fausto]] sought them out, paying well but always pushing them to be a little more ruthless. When [[Vargus]] tried to get out, [[Fausto]] did something to him, with this cold iron crown, the [[Crown of Purity]]. From them on, [[Valius]] did what [[Fausto]] said, to keep his brother alive. Eventually, they were sent with the sorcerer [[Evelina]] to travel east, looking for old artifacts from [[Drankor]], ending up in the [[Orcs]]' territory, spying and scouting. From [[Valius]], the party also learns a little more about [[The Cleansed]]. Their memories and personalities are not gone, just suspended: occasionally [[Vargus]] would have lucid moments, and talk about it feeling like a fog had lifted, but then the mists would close in again. 

Next, the party talks to [[Antonia]]. It is clear after talking to her for a few minutes that she quite dislikes [[Orcs|orcs]] and undead, and believes that [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] is destined to be restored to greatness. [[Antonia]] does not know that [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] is undead; she clearly believes that finding the cloak, scepter, and crown is all required to restore him to life, to resurrect him. She believes that [[Vargus]], [[Vola]], and [[Hektor]] volunteered to be purified, cleansed of their impure blood, and the process went wrong. She believes [[Fausto]] is working to fix the process, to make it safe, so all humans can be cleansed and purified for the new dawn of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. It takes some time, but eventually [[Delwath]] convinces her that [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] is a trapped undead and [[Fausto]] seeks to free him, not resurrect him. This seems to shatter her resistance, and she tells the party what she knows. [[Grash]] has presumably spoken via Sending with [[Casian]], and is likely on his way to attack the city. He suspects the party has the [[Scepter of Command]], from talking to dead werewolves outside [[Tokra]], and if he gets the cloak and the scepter, [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] can return in full power. The party agrees to leave her in the mirror for a year or two, and possibly release her in exile in the north, near [[Voltara]], when [[Grash]] and [[Fausto]] are dead.

After some discussion, it is decided that [[Riswynn]] will remain and defend the city from the undead, with her divine magic, while the rest of the party flies north to destroy the scepter, preventing [[Grash]] from ever obtaining it. With this decided, the party speaks with [[Casian]], who is dismissive and rude, insisting he will be rescued when [[Grash]] comes, up until the minute he is slain. 

Finally, as the days passes noon, the party looks at the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] in [[The Mirror of the Past]], seeing the [[Mantle of Protection Vision]]. Then, [[Riswynn]] begins casting the Hallow spell, to bless the throne room, which takes 24 hours. The next day, as the spell casting is done, [[Seeker]] is reluctantly dragged into the room, freeing him of the fey curse of ice. 

We end as [[Riswynn]] sets herself to casting Forbiddance, and the rest of the party turns north on [[Vindristjarna]] to destroy the scepter.

The session begins on the road, at the edge of the mountains, with the party contemplating their next move. After some discussion of the relative merits of trying the front door, or searching in the mountains for a back door, either over the cliffs or via the hidden exit from the [[Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)|dwarven outpost]] marked on [[Riswynn]]’s maps, the party decides to try the mountain route. Heading east, the party aims for a mountain valley just to the west of [[Raven's Hold]], hoping to find a route through or over and thus avoid the plains of cursed insanity vines encountered by [[Ander Charmheart]] to ill effect.

[[Riswynn]]'s map of the [[Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)]]:
![[Raven Hold Dwarves.png]]

The area here is rough hilly terrain, with various loose erratic boulders and stones. Just before getting to the mountain stream flowing into the plains, [[Seeker]] notices a volcanic boulder that seems very out of place, as there don’t seem to be active volcanoes here. Searching, he finds a faint impression of Dwarven runes, indicating the number 2300, and also realizes the boulder was probably not naturally deposited here. With some searching, [[Seeker]] (assisted by [[Wellby]]) finds another out of place stone, this time marked with the number 2100. Continuing to search up the river valley, they find stones every few hundred feet, counting down what seems to be a distance. When the numbers get down to about 500, the fast-flowing stream turns into a high sided mountain gorge and heads into the mountain. Instead of a number, Dwarven runes spelling “enter” are carved here.

The party heads into the gorge, first stopping to try to figure out if the water is safe. After forcing a rabbit, now named [[Taster]], to drink some, and seeing it does not die, they head into the stream. Eventually, the walls become tighter and narrower, and the stream enters a tunnel, meaning once again the horses must be left behind, with most of the supplies, food, and gear. After another few hundred feet in the tunnel, with the floor gradually sloping up, but the ceiling staying level, the water gets deeper and deeper until the party cannot proceed without swimming underwater.

After some discussion, [[Delwath]] scouts ahead and sees that the tunnel is blocked by a diagonal metal plate, with a chain on the wall of the tunnel. [[Riswynn]] dislodges and pulls on the chain, which causes the metal plate to slide into the floor, and redirects the flow of water to a grate in the ground. As the water drains, the party proceeds into the dark. The tunnels continue for some time, as the party passes a guard room with a mysterious lever and a secret door they decide not to pull, and an illusion of a pile of rubble, until coming to a blank wall.

With some investigation, [[Wellby]] finds a mechanism to open a secret door. The door swings open, revealing a large cavern. The door itself opens onto a raised area, maybe 25’ feet on a side. Beyond, two large pools of water can be seen in the dark. Standing on the platform, turning in surprise as the door swings open, is a [[Inakara|quite unusual creature]]. She is dwarf-sized, but clearly not a dwarf: she has bedraggled white hair, long black nails, and gray and purplish skin that looks mottled and bruised. About twenty or thirty others of her kind are in the cavern -- a few, looking better armed, on the platform with her, and the rest huddled around the shores of the pools. She speaks broken Dwarven, and immediately questions the party, hissing and licking her fingers as she talks. Eventually it becomes apparent that she wants the party to fight something for her, and will let them pass if they do this. Without giving much more information, she leads them down a passage towards a huge open cavern, the former trading hall of the outpost, and points, and kind of shoves the party out into the cavern, telling them to fight. Although a bit uncertain of her motives, the party proceeds. As the party warily creeps into the cavern, a tentacle flies out of the darkness, grabbing [[Wellby]], as one of the stalagmites begins to move and send tentacles flying. [[Wellby]] is drawn closer and closer, and bitten by its vicious stone teeth, as the party struggles to figure out how to penetrate its tough stony hide while dodging the flying tentacles. Eventually, though, the party realizes that this creature can barely move, and by staying out of range (and with a well-placed arrow from [[Wellby]], heated to sear flesh by [[Seeker]]), they wear down its defenses, defeating it as the session ends.

## Narrative
We begin as the party departs [[Uzgukhar]], north to find a volcano in which to destroy the [[Scepter of Command]]. Flying nearly 24 hours, the party covers more than 200 miles per day. The first three days are spend crossing the [[Plaguelands]], including a brief flyover of [[Isingue]], a ruined trading city south of [[Sembara]]. In [[Isingue]], [[Seeker]] brings the ship lower, noting that the entire ground of the city seems to be teeming with a strange black squirming mold. Which attacks, launched a black globule of acidic ooze that begins to burn through the stone of the ship, until it is burned out by [[Wellby]].

Continuing north, the party crosses the [[Western Gulf]], hearing [[Wellby]]'s stories of his childhood on the ocean (including the tale of seeing a giant underwater dragon when he was 9). [[Kenzo]] also communes with the nature of the gulf, feeling the teaming life on the surface, and the strange dark canyon depths where giant crabs scuttle beneath the reach of sunlight.

On the morning of Dec 16th, the party reaches [[Tollen]], where they are met by a harbor launch with a dozen guards and one of the harbor masters. She welcomes them to [[Tollen]], but insists a guard be posted on the airship to keep the city safe. This negotiation done, the party heads to the busy, cold docks of [[Tollen]] in winter, where they split up.

[[Wellby]] and [[Seeker]] head north, to [[Scrollwright Street]], heading for the shop of [[Guy Marchand]], a mapmaker who [[Wellby]] knew from his childhood, who sold [[Wellby]] some of his early books and maps. Guy is happy to see [[Wellby]], and they talk about his journeys and life. Guy recounts how the first time he met [[Wellby]], he tried to shoo him away, but [[Wellby]] walked up to a giant map, pointed to the further place (an island north and east of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]), and asked "What's there?" Guy also tells [[Wellby]] he is happy to introduce him to a university student he knows, [[Sarah de Gray]], a fellow Isinguer. Guy also shows [[Wellby]] a fragment of a map recovered from some abandoned fort north up the [[Volta]], that shows the elevations of a section of the central mountain chain. 

While [[Wellby]] and [[Seeker]] speak with Guy, [[Delwath]] wanders through the markets of the [[Bridgeward]] district, looking for furniture makers, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other artisans to outfit the skyship, buying some kitchen supplies and basic furniture, and getting quotes for larger construction projects. [[Delwath]] also collects rumors and news, hearing especially about [[Melindir]], an elf from [[Orenlas]], and [[Caelynn]] the Seer, a [[Fey]] woman variously claimed to be 4000 years old, or the last in a long line of [[Caelynn]] the Seers, who accumulates many conflicting stories and rumors.

[[Kenzo]] wanders looking for the best tattoo parlor, ending up across the [[Tollen]] Bridge, in the [[Southbridge]] district, in the shop of [[Cecilia Lister]]. She is a neat and precise woman, with a neat and precise shop. [[Kenzo]] and Cecilia talk tattoos (Cecilia is quite interested in [[Kenzo]]'s lizardfolk tattoos) -- [[Kenzo]] expresses interest in getting magical ink. Cecilia agrees, and asks him to come back the day after tomorrow. She also says that, for a client, she will introduce him to Escobar, a student at the [[University of Tollen]] who is supported by a [[Dyer's Guild]] scholarship. 

Despite not making a plan to meet up, the party manages to meet together at [[The Windward Sail]], a halfling inn in [[Fiskurth]], the sailor's district near the docks, and recount their days and contacts. [[Wellby]] knows the tavern owner, [[Wendel Quickstep]], and after the dinner rush dies down, they speak for a while, after [[Wellby]] joins in the halfling storytelling that happens after the music ends. Wendel is happy to hear about [[Wellby]]'s journeys, and tells the party about [[Nika Hyne]], a sort-of student who hangs around a lot hearing stories, and knows everyone at the university, as well as the [[Temple of Kaikkea]] in the [[Godshome]] district, where they can find a Skaer to speak with. 

[[Nika Hyne|Nika]] wanders in later that night, and Wendel introduces her. She is a bit squirrelly and doesn't immediately click with [[Delwath]], especially, but reveals a number of interesting rumors, including that [[Caelynn]] trades in secrets, and will take a secret from you if you wish. She tells (for 5 silver) the party about [[Umli]] the Exile, a stoneborn metalworker and expert in fire magic, and agrees to guide them around the university, including taking them to meet [[Umli]], the next day after lunch. The day ends with the party heading to sleep having made an impression in [[Tollen]]: rumors of the elf with the flying ship, and rumors of the troubles in [[Dunmar]], now spreading like wildfire.

The next morning, the party heads to speak with [[Melindir]], the elf, right after breakfast. On the walk, [[Delwath]] talks about his feelings meeting an elf and feeling like he has missed so much of his generation; he is slightly cheered by the thought that perhaps there is another elf somewhere trapped in another shadow realm, who he might still find companionship with. 

[[Melindir]] lives in the nice part of town, [[Gold Street]], near many guild headquarters, the new Temple to [[The Warlord]] being constructed by the shipwright's guild where [[Guildgate]] and [[Godshome]] meet. From [[Melindir]], the party learns a little more about [[Orenlas]], and makes plans to visit there, finding an old elf who might remember [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]. [[Melindir]] also tells them that the Skaer have been looking for adventurers, to help deal with some curse, and tells them to be cautious around Caerlynn. 

The session ends with the party leaving [[Melindir]]'s apartments, heading to the [[Temple of Kaikkea]].

## Narrative
***Part 1: [[Tollen]]***

We begin as the party leaves [[Melindir]]'s apartments, after having made plans for dinner the following night, and walks through the rich part of [[Tollen]], full of elaborate palaces of merchants and guild leaders. They reach the [[Temple of Kaikkea]], and ancient building of white marble on a empty plaza. Inside, they meet [[Iskra]], the priestess of [[Kaikkea]] in [[Tollen]]. From her, the party learns of [[Kaikkea]], and also hears about the dangers on the island of [[Vetta|Vetta]] that have prevented the Skaer from making pilgrimages to the sacred waters there for 10 months. [[Iskra]] gives the party letters of introduction to [[Skalme]], the fire priestess on the volcanic island of [[Antaka]], and [[Vaallinen]], the priest in the town of [[Pyhlla]], the launching point for pilgrims to [[Vetta]]. 

Around noon, the party leaves the temple to meet [[Nika Hyne]], who is going to guide them to meet [[Umli]], the [[Stoneborn]], and [[Caelynn]] the Seer. [[Umli]] is interviewing new students at the dwarven tavern *[[The Fire and Stone]]*, in the [[Magnus Street]] district, near the [[University of Tollen]]. After watching her a while, [[Seeker]] presents his miniatures of glass and stone, which doesn't go over super well. [[Delwath]], however convinces her to speak by catching her interest with strange metals: the shadow shard from his breastplate, and the [[adamantine]] shield (which [[Umli]] describes as being made by a medium-skilled smith, which feels like high praise from her). From [[Umli]], the party learns about the volcano at [[Antaka]], and some general information about volcanos and destroying things in them, including the fact that powerful magic can reveal the weakness of artifacts. [[Caelynn]] the Seer, in [[Tollen]], possesses this magic, as does [[Skalme]], on [[Antaka]].  

After speaking with [[Umli]], the party meets [[Caelynn]] the Seer at her small, elegant apartment, unassuming from the outside. Inside, it is twilight, but feels larger and more spacious that it appeared from the street. While [[Kenzo]] waits outside, [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and [[Delwath]] enter and speak with her. She is a tricky conversationalist, and the party does not want to give away much, any memories or secrets. But she does eventually reveal to [[Delwath]] that many of his kind ended up in [[Dreamhaven]], a fey realm across the mountains. And [[Seeker]] decides to trade his book "Infinite Gates of [[Kenzo]]: a book in which one selects one's own adventure. Fight the gnolls? Close the gate? You decide!" [[Caelynn]] is fascinated with this, and tells [[Seeker]] much about volcanoes and the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] in return. The party learns about the elemental portals that linger in the world, and the way in which the elemental planes can both create and destroy, depending on the weakness and resonance of whatever is to be destroyed, and that the safest way to enter the elemental planes is with an invitation. 

Leaving [[Caelynn]]'s, [[Kenzo]] returns to the [[Temple of Kaikkea]] to bond with [[Iskra]], collect [[Iskra's Story|her story]], and impress her with his large spiritual presence, while the rest of the party returns to the inn. 

The next morning, [[Kenzo]] returns to [[Cecilia Lister]]'s tattoo parlor, listens to her [[Cecilia Lister's Story|story]], and has his tattoos of [[Lengau]] and [[Motua]] magically enhanced, as well as receiving a letter of introduction to [[Escobar Garavito]], a well-connected student at the University, supported by a [[Dyer's Guild]] scholarship. The party reschedules dinner with [[Melindir]] and postpones meeting [[Sarah de Gray]], as after lunch they depart, heading north and east towards [[Antaka]]. 

***Part 2: [[Skaerhem]]***

The party spends the afternoon of Dec 18th, as well as all day on the 19th and 20th, flying north and east, crossing the forests and rocky coasts of [[Vostok]], and then the open sea of the [[Western Green Sea]]. Around dawn on Dec 21st, the party reaches [[Antaka]]. This is a medium-sized rocky island, dominated by a single large volcano, still very active, and connected to the plane of fire. The Skaer have a temple here, built of dark volcanic rock, with a roof of polished obsidian, arranged to echo the shape of the volcano behind it. The priestess [[Skalme]] is waiting here, as her morning prayers warned her the party was coming. 

They speak with [[Skalme]], about the volcano, hoping to learn more about how to destroy the scepter. She takes their offering of gold and silver, and prays, learning that the [[Scepter of Command]] was created when [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] bound the soul of a fiend to it, which protects it from fire, and almost all other damage. It can only be destroyed by immersion for 24 hours in sacred waters, during the full moon, which will weaken the bond of the fiend enough to shatter the object (potentially releasing the fiend).

The party then heads to [[Pyhlla]], the Skaer village that is the base from which pilgrims to [[Vetta|Vetta]] depart. On the way, they fly over [[Vetta|Vetta]], seeing the mists that surround it, and using Clairvoyance to observe some demons milling around the entrance to the caldera temple complex.  

Arriving at [[Pyhlla]] at dusk, the party meets the priest, [[Vaallinen]], at the temple, which appears to be the center of the community. It is dark when they arrive. Most of the village is lit by Continual Light torches that give off no heat, but a bonfire is burning at the temple, and it warms the party as they eat and drink. [[Vaallinen]] tells the party more about the problem: the sacred hot springs on [[Vetta|Vetta]] were attacked about 10 months ago by a pirate -- a Skaer exile -- named [[Urgall the Black]]. The island of [[Vetta|Vetta]] is protected by [[Kaikkea]], and those who steal from it or dishonor the sacred springs can supposedly never leave. However, [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] attacked anyway, perhaps aided or encouraged by the demonic fiend he bound himself to for power. Only one person -- [[Tulvak]], the ferry captain -- escaped from the island alive. Since then, nine Skaer warriors, and four Tollender mercenaries, have sailed into the mists, and not returned. 

After dinner, the party talks amongst themselves for a bit, and then speaks with [[Tulvak]]. He tells of the attack -- pirates with flaming swords, lead by the captain with fire magic who blasted the entire long house where [[Tulvak]] was staying with the pilgrims. The only reason he survived was that he was outside relieving himself. [[Tulvak]] also tells them of a hidden cove, in the north, where they can land, and also that the temple complex is connected by lava tubes, which provide connections between the various hot springs. 

***Part 3: [[Vetta|Vetta]]***

The next morning -- Dec 22 -- the party is blessed by [[Kaikkea]] at dawn, and then leaves for [[Vetta|Vetta]], flying [[Vindristjarna]] over the mist barrier, before hiding it with hallucinatory terrain and proceeding to the cove on the north side of the island, beaching their [[Folding Boat]] on a narrow black sand beach surrounded by cliffs. At the top of the cliff, [[Seeker]] sits down to look at rocks for a moment, and notices that the lava on the top of the cliff is much older than the lava forming the sand beach at the base of the cliff, inferring that a newer lava flow must pass under the cliffs. 

Thinking about the lava tubes, [[Seeker]] decides to search the base of the cliff, using [[Kenzo]]'s cloak of the manta ray, while [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] scout the caldera and [[Delwath]] keeps watch. Although the water is freezing, [[Seeker]] (with the aid of [[Delwath]] warming his clothes to keep him from being exhausted with cold) finds an entrance to a flooded lava tube, maybe 10 feet below water. Meanwhile, [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] see the layout of the temple complex clearly, and observe a large vulture-like demon flying around in circles, keeping watch on the whole area. [[Kenzo]] jumps 500 feet down to the caldera floor to further scout the priest's quarters, hearing the raving mutterings of [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]], the pirate captain.

The party decides to attempt to enter via the lava tube [[Seeker]] found. The first few hundred feet are underwater, a challenge easily surmounted with quick swimmers, the cloak of the manta ray, and a potion of water breathing. More difficult is the collapsed roof a thousand feet further in, forming a 20-foot section blocked by rubble. A mouse scout summoned by [[Wellby]] dies after crawling though, but the party proceeds anyway, using a potion of hill giant strength to allow [[Seeker]] to be strong and clear the boulders over the course of an hour.

Moving forward in the lava tube, through the poisonous water which poisons [[Seeker]] and [[Wellby]], the party finds a trapdoor leading to what was once [[Jorma]]'s quarters (the priest of the waters). [[Urgall the Black]] now dwells here, mostly undead and brooding obsessively over his treasure. The party surprises him in his obsession, managing to get the jump on him and do a considerable amount of damage (especially with [[Seeker]]'s holy water launched with the catapult spell) before he can react. Once he finds his footing, he manages to infect [[Wellby]] briefly with his madness of greed, forcing him to chase after illusory gold, but is quickly dispatched by the party. 

Returning to the tunnels, the party finds there way to the heart of the complex, the sacred waters of [[Kaikkea]], where a massive demon sits, corrupting the sacred pool. An epic battle ensues: the demon flings water, poison, and blinding acidic spray while attempting to grapple and drag people with its tentacles and gnaw at them with its vicious teeth. [[Kenzo]] -- immune to poison -- locks down the monster, keeping it frightened and forcing it to consume his tentacles to resist [[Kenzo]]'s frightening strike. [[Seeker]] gets the worst of it, caught by acid and bile and poison, until falling unconscious in the poisonous waters, slipping below the water. But in the end the party prevails, and the demon is destroyed, and the waters run clear. 

The next day, after a much needed rest, the party explores. They quickly dispatch the remaining zombies and other undead (the demons apparently being forced back to the [[Abyss]] with their master), return the various looted treasures of the sacred springs to their proper places, and tend to the bodies of the dead. Hoping to find out more about what happened, the party also uses the mirror to look at [[Urgall's Helm Vision]]. Finally, during the day they find and search the [[Flaming Tempest]], [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]]'s ship, finding trade goods, some gold, and a ciphered scroll.

The next dawn, Dec 24th, the party returns to the sacred waters and places the scepter in the water to soak for 24 hours. Over the next day, everyone keeps watch, unable to sleep, as the scepter soaks. In is tense and difficult, as the scepter seems to gather visions of its power around it, and the party is on edge as the sun rises at dawn. At this moment, [[Delwath]] uses his sword to create a magic circle, in case a devil emerges from the scepter. [[Kenzo]] draws up his staff, the power of the deep, untamed ocean, the power of [[Kaikkea]] flowing with him, and strikes the scepter, shattering it. As he does, an evil wind blows, blocked by the magic circle, and a faint howl can be heard as the tattered remains of the soul of the devil bound to this thing fade out of existence. 

The scepter destroyed, [[Wellby]] walks into the morning sun, followed by the rest of the party.

We end the session on the morning of Dec 25th, as the party hails a ship from [[Pyhlla]], and speaks with [[Vaallinen]] and [[Tulvak]], telling them all that happened here.

## Narrative
We begin as the party has been traveling for three days, across the [[Western Green Sea]] and the interior forests of [[Vostok]], and is approaching [[Tollen]]. During this time, [[Delwath]] has been [[Scrying Late Dec 1748|scrying, and messages have come in]].

Arriving in [[Tollen]], the party receive letters from various contacts from a [[Halflings|halfling]] messenger sent by [[Wendel Quickstep]] from [[The Windward Sail]], and split up to handle errands. [[Kenzo]] speaks with [[Cecilia Lister]], from whom he learns about the [[Dyer's Guild]] [[Pyravela]] party, and also hears that [[Jane Chapman]] is a good person to speak to about [[Ursk]]. [[Kenzo]] also meets with [[Escobar Garavito|Escobar]] at the university, who tells him that [[Thomas Hawke]] is the person to meet; he'll be at the university party tomorrow. [[Wellby]] tells the story of the destruction of the scepter at various [[Halflings|halfling]] inns, spreading the word and building its tale into the song of this year. [[Seeker]] works on mechanical devices, with mixed success, building a pinball machine that is quite fiddly to actually load balls into. And [[Delwath]] spreads the word about the party, with mixed success. Between [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]], it is clear that the word is out, but many people are a bit surprised that an [[Elves|elf]] and a Dunmari are hosting a [[Pyravela]] party, given the holiday's association with [[Mos Numena]] and [[The Wyrdling]].

The next day, the party attends the [[Pyravela]] parade, full of floats depicting miracles of [[The Wyrdling]], and led by a procession of the elders of the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]], said to be the oldest guild in the city, dating to before [[The Downfall]] of [[Hkar]]. Also watching the parade is a centaur, [[Aurelia]]; [[Delwath]] and [[Kenzo]] speak with her briefly, learning she has lived here for 20 years, turning away from the migratory habits of most of her people to really get to know one place. 

After the parade, the party heads to [[Scrollwright Street]], finding the Isinguese party hosted by [[Guy Marchand]] spilling out into the street. Everyone is wearing floral colors, feather masks, and dancing in a big circle around a fire, to the melodies of an accordion. A huge spread of food -- long, snake-like pastries, tomato jam,  cheese, and lots of mulled wine -- is set up next to the band, and everyone seems to be having a great time. Guy eventually waves [[Sarah de Gray]] over, who is a young girl of maybe 16, and who seems to be having a great time at the party. [[Wellby]] begins talking about the acidic ooze infesting [[Isingue]], which doesn't go over so well in the party atmosphere, and then eventually asks about [[Ursk]]. Sarah doesn't seem to know much, but introduces [[Wellby]] to [[Hugo Dupont]], a professor at the university.

Hugo is an older man, not in the best shape, but still clearly enjoying the party and dancing as best he can. He is interested in [[Wellby]]'s news about the acidic ooze occupying [[Isingue]], and says he will write to people he knows in the south, but also asks [[Wellby]] if he would visit the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]]. He is a scholar of comparative divinity and practical theology, and while he doesn't have much news of [[Ursk]], he does report that there are curiously no records of the form the gods take in that land. 

Later that day, the party leaves the Isinguer street party and makes their way along [[Scrollwright Street]] to [[Magnus Street]], the university district. It is much more of a carnival atmosphere: one of the main courtyards is lit up with magic, people are playing dice games and other games of chance, and the vibe is noisy and raucous. Drifting through the party, the party finds [[Thomas Hawke]], elegantly dressed and handsome. He is speaking at a packed inner courtyard full of his fans, reciting a monologue from one of his plays. It is the story of a sailor, shipwrecking, bemoaning the poor choices in his life, praying to [[The Wyrdling]] for another chance to make things right. After the recitation is done, the party talks to Thomas, who is a playwright and a collector of stories. Although he has little to say about [[Ursk]], he agrees to an exchange of stories. [[Wellby]] tells the story of [[Arryn]] the Wanderer and the mirror dimension, as Thomas records with a magic quill, changing [[Wellby]]'s name. In exchange, Thomas tells a story about magical jade, the inspiration for [[Luminastra's Gift]], the play his monologue was from, a story of Luminastra, a magic whale, and Geoffrey the Sailor, shipwrecked, rescued, and taken to a magical world below the ocean. This, Thomas says, was inspired by a real tale, a story from the oceans west of [[Chardon]], where a garden of magical jade rows beneath the ocean, tended to by [[Merfolk]], who would grow names in their garden. Obviously, the party reliezes that this may be related to a [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]].  

The next morning, the party spends time in preparation for hosting a [[Pyravela]] feast on [[Vindristjarna]], and then heads to [[The Fire and Stone]] to meet [[Umli]] in the afternoon. She is excited by [[Delwath]]'s shadow metal, which she says is called *[[Inkaye]]* (in-ka-yay) by her people. It is a metal that can absorb and repurpose extraplanar energy. She can shape it into something new, if desired, and also make weapons or armor with the [[Skaer steel]] the party brought back. The session ends as the party leaves [[The Fire and Stone]], to handle last minute preparations for their feast before heading to the [[Dyer's Guild]] party.

## Narrative
We begin on Dec 30th, the second day of the [[Pyravela]] festival, as the party heads to the [[Dyer's Guild]] guildhall, where the guild is hosting an elaborate [[Pyravela]] party. It is crowded, and much more explicitly religious than the [[Session 82 (DuFr)|parties yesterday]], with priests of [[the wyrdling]] wandering around, giving blessings and asking for donations to various charitable causes. Several familiar faces are at the party, including the tattoo artist [[Cecilia Lister]] and [[Escobar Garavito]], the student on a [[Dyer's Guild]] scholarship. 

[[Cecilia Lister]] introduces the party to [[Delios the Sage]], an old man wearing plain white robes, not in costume like most other people, who is a member of the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]]. He seems fascinated by the amount of magic the party is carrying around, and asks where they got so many magic items, which leads to a discussion of [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]. Delios reveals -- apparently gleaning information from a scroll he carries -- that [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]] is one of the seven dragons that hatched from eggs that grew from [[Cha'mutte]]'s destroyed body. They discuss [[Frankar]], and [[Rai]] (who Delios says flew over [[Tollen]] in a flying castle before the [[Great War]]), and the fey. Delios and the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]] do not particularly get along with [[Caelynn]], it seems. Delios also speaks of [[Agata]], finally making the connection that the party is the group that killed her, and reveals that she has always wanted revenge on [[Dunmar]] for their role in the [[Great War]] and the defeat of [[Cha'mutte]]. [[Agata]], according to Delios, wished to see [[Dunmar]] destroyed from within, leading the party to relieze that nobody hired her to kidnap [[Sura]], it was her goal all along to sow discord for her own reasons (as [[Hralgar]] said [[Session 14 (DuFr)|long ago]], she was motived by revenge). Finally, they discuss Mashtu the Corruptor, a demon, but it is hard to know if what the party killed on [[Vetta]] was, indeed Mashtu or simply Mashtu's servant. At this point, Delios does not answer more questions, saying he must circulate, but does tell the party the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]] is always interested in trading information, especially the lost and hidden kind, for magic items, if they wish to visit after [[Pyravela]]. 

Still at the [[Dyer's Guild]] party, [[Escobar Garavito]] then introduces the party to [[Jane Chapman]], a captain of a trading ship, and one of the people in [[Tollen]] who has been to [[Ursk]]. From Jane, the party learns that [[Ursk]] is a strange, magical place, a place that does not welcome foreigners, and where no one speaks Common, much less Sembaran or any of the languages of the Western [[Green Sea|Green Sea]]. Although she does not have a ton of information about what is beyond the walls of the closed city, she does suggest that if the party wishes to go there, approaching from the empty northern wastes might be easier than the guarded ports. As the conversation ends, the [[Dyer's Guild]] fireworks begin, and the party stays to watch for a bit, before leaving to prepare [[Vindristjarna]] for their own party. 

The [[Vindristjarna]] party draws an eclectic crowd, with many people who are not part of the [[Mos Numena]] religion and perhaps often feel a bit out of place at many [[Pyravela]] parties. This includes the [[Elves|elves]], [[Melindir]] and his guest [[Elwis]], who he will introduce at dinner in a few days; the Skaer [[Iskra]] and [[Kaupa]]; many halfings, including [[Wellby]]'s cousins [[Chenna Goodbarrel]] and [[Harriet Goodbarrel]]; the centaur [[Aurelia]]; numerous [[Kenku]]; as well as many Tollenders curious about this strange party. 

[[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] are putting on an acrobatics show; [[Delwath]] plays host, wandering the crowd;  [[Seeker]] is engrossed in the pinball machine he made, when an old [[Dwarves|dwarf]], who walks with a limp and cane, walks straight for [[Seeker]]. He introduces himself as [[Faldrak Bronzehammer]]. He is a tinker and crafter, curious about the ship, because he is looking for someone to take him to a place called the Edge of Echoes, where elemental planes are close, he believes. He wants to get there because it is, he thinks, only their that he can finally finish animating his pet stone bird. He is ready to leave now - or, at least, once he learns the exact location of the Edge of Echoes from the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]], and makes plans with [[Seeker]] to meet for breakfast on Saturday (presumably, at least in Faldrak's mind, to then leave for the Edge of Echoes). In exchange for a ride, he will fiddle with [[Seeker]]'s [[Glove of Crystalized Magic]]. The two of them then begin to fiddle with [[Seeker]]'s mostly-functional pinball machine.

While [[Seeker]] has been talking to [[Faldrak Bronzehammer]], [[Delwath]] is circulating, picking up little bits of information. He learns that the Holy Well of Parmo, mentioned in [[Urgall's scroll]], is a holy site on a small island of the coast of [[Cymea]], presumably visiting by [[Urgall the Black]], based on [[Wellby]]'s reconstruction of the logs of the [[Flaming Tempest]]. He learns rumors of the empty spaces west of [[Ursk]], and the empty northern wastes beyond [[Ursk]].

[[Wellby]], as the acrobatics show ends, finds himself talking to some [[Kenku]], about the [[Kenku]] he met far to the east, the history of the [[Kenku]], how they found themselves hiding from the world after the [[Great War]], and how maybe it is time to reintegrate a little bit. [[Wellby]] also hears about the huge [[Monsters]] that lurk in the northern wastes, giant snow worms that hunt based on vibrations on the snow pack; but he grabs the interest of some [[Kenku]], and if the party ever decides to travel to [[Ursk]] across the far northern wastes, [[Wellby]] now has connections to find a [[Kenku]] guide to come along. 

[[Kenzo]], after the show, finds himself mostly spending time with [[Iskra]], who has spent most of her time watching the show, [[Kenzo]] in particular. In the early morning hours, [[Kenzo]] and [[Iskra]] leave together, as the party winds down. 

The next day is the most spiritual day of [[Pyravela]], when [[the Wyrdling]] grants prayers and visions to those who pray to them, and the festival ends with bonfires. The party each handle this day in their own way. [[Kenzo]] spends the day with [[Iskra]], talking to her about [[Tollen]], and about [[Kaikkea]], and walking with her, together but apart from the worship of [[the Wyrdling]], as neither [[Kenzo]] nor [[Iskra]] are part of the [[Mos Numena]] faith. [[Wellby]] spends the day as [[Halflings|halflings]] normally do, gathering and telling stories and being together with family, not concerned with the gods of [[Humans|humans]], but relishing the quiet space to create [[Halflings|halfling]] traditions. [[Delwath]] wanders, listening to the [[tanshi]], and hearing their perspective on the festival; for the tanshi this all seems too big, too grand, too impersonal and distant. [[Seeker]] also wanders a bit, just observing.

We end as the sun rises on the new year, 1749, and the party gathers to plan their last days in [[Tollen]], before heading south to speak with the [[Elves|elves]] of [[Orenlas]], and eventually return to [[Riswynn]] and the [[Orcs]] of [[Xurkhaz]], defending [[Uzgukhar]] from [[Grash]] and his undead army.

## Narrative
We begin on Jan 1st, 1749, as the new year, by [[Tollen]] reckoning, dawns. 

*On the skyship [[Vindristjarna]], however, none of the travelers would mark this as the dawning of a new year, were they not in [[Tollen]]. 

*The hammers and bells of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]] of the [[Sentinel Range]] will not ring to mark the new year for another few months, until March 17th in the human reckoning. Few except the dwarven lorekeepers now remember, but this will mark the beginning of the 5,882nd year since the planes were pulled apart and time began on Taelgar.*

*In [[Dunmar]], the new year -- the 192nd year of the Nayan Dynasty -- will not come for another three weeks, when the The Festival of the New Dawn on January 23rd marks the end of the holy month, and the beginning of the new year.*

*Among the [[Halflings]] in their ships and caravans traveling the world, the new year has started already, when the days began to lengthen after the winter solstice. The song of the Year of Shadowed Dreams is over, and the song of the new year is beginning.*

*To the [[Elves|elves]], the turning of the year, the days growing shorter, and then longer, then shorter again, is merely a small part of the larger cycle of the ka, the elven count of generations, stretching back to the original [[Elves|elves]] who lived in the shadows of the Firstborn, and does not usually warrant much comment or celebration by itself.

The party spends the day of the new year on [[Vindristjarna]], taking a much needed respite. [[Wellby]] works on his extensive maps; [[Kenzo]] tends the budding garden; [[Seeker]] tinkers with his mechanical creations; and [[Delwath]] watches the horizon, thinking. 

The following day, on Friday, Jan 2nd, the party goes to visit the guildhall of the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]]. It is in the oldest part of the city, the [[Skepwalk]] district, an oasis of quiet and calm nestled among shipyards and busy taverns, with a strangely out-of-season garden. Inside, the party is served tea and settled at a small table; there are a few other people here, but their conversations fade into silence as the party sits down. Soon, [[Delios the Sage]] emerges, happy to see the party again. After some discussion, the party ends up asking for information about four things.

First, they trade the [[Mace of Terror]] for information about the [[Binding Stones]] taken from [[Stormcaller Tower]], that had been involved in trapping [[Hralgar]]. Delios tells them that these stones can be used to create a powerful, nearly eternal prison, trapping a creature in chains, or in a tomb underground, or in eternal sleep. This prison can only be undone by the most powerful magic, or by a specific event that must be specified when the prison is created. (Metagame: what he is describing is the 9th level spell [Imprisonment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/imprisonment)). But there is added complexity, that Delios cannot explain now, and requires further research, saying that it will take one or two weeks to get a full answer. 

Second, they trade the two spellbooks (the [[Arcane Grimoire]] from [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]'s hoard, and Cassian's chalyte spellbook), for information about the shattered [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand|jade pieces of Rai's hand]], and information about [[Rai]] and [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] and how [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] was imprisoned.

Delios gives the party information about the jade forest, west of [[Chardon]], for free. This is a forest of kelp, and living stone coral, maybe 600 or 700 miles due west of [[Chardon]], about a 100 miles off the coast of the peninsula. It is apparently tended by [[Merfolk]] and other denizens of the oceans. And, he says, the guild will do their best to find information that could lead to the location of the final fragment, that fell in the rainforest, but he cannot promise anything, and this will take considerable time. 

Delios also speaks briefly of [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s imprisonment. He says that [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] kept his soul, his life essence, safely stored outside his body; unless that phylactery (soul jar) is destroyed, [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] cannot truly be destroyed. Delios says the guild suspects that the imprisonment that [[Cha'mutte]] constructed, and [[Rai]] maintained, had something to do with manipulating the connection between [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] and his phylactery, keeping him trapped in [[Drankor]] and slowly losing his power. He thinks, but is not certain, that [[Rai]] somehow held this prison together with his hand, perhaps gripping the phylactery itself and keeping [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] from accessing it. But, he says, the true nature of this imprisonment, and its connection to [[Rai]], will need to be verified and studied before he can say more for sure. 

Finally, [[Seeker]] asks after his brother, [[Frankar]], trading the [[Floating Disc Coin]] for information about whether he is alive, and if so where he is, and how he got there. Delios says that the guild is aware he is alive, but further time will be necessary before he can say for sure where [[Frankar]] might be now. 

After this conversation, the party departs the guildhall, and returns to the ship to be ready to host [[Melindir]] and [[Elwis]] for dinner. [[Elwis]] is a painter from [[Orenlas]], and is in town to learn more about the magic inks used in tattoos here, after traveling around [[Green Sea]] for the past several years. She speaks with [[Delwath]] about [[Orenlas]], talking of the beauty of the forest, the grandeur of the ancient city of [[Erelion]], and the ancient feeling as if it were still the days of creation when Aldanor walked the earth. 

The next morning, [[Faldrak Bronzehammer]] arrives, ready to leave. He has traded for information about the [[Edge of Echoes]] from the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]]. He has learned that is in central [[Cymea]], on the [[Freccilia]] (FREH-chee-lah) River, just upstream from its confluence with the [[Ampogio]] (ahm-POH-joh) River. Now, it is claimed by the locals simply to be a haunted cave system, but long ago it was a Drankorian forge, where the power of the elemental planes that leaks through here was harnessed to create magic. Faldrak, armed with this information, has packed his stuff already, assuming that the party will set out immediately. 

Although the party is not quite ready to leave right away, they agree to go to the [[Edge of Echoes]], and to share 1/16 of the treasure they find there with Faldrak, in exchange for work on [[Seeker]]'s [[Glove of Crystalized Magic]] and on [[Vindristjarna]]. Faldrak, for example, suggests some kind of fire-shooting cannon, and demostrates what he means by picking up his cane and releasing a blast of fire from it, saying, "like that, but bigger!"

We end that afternoon, as Faldrak contacts a furniture maker friend he knows to get nice beds for [[Vindristjarna]], and the rest of the party disperses to the final tasks in [[Tollen]] before departing.

## Narrative
During the first days of the new year, the party spends time in [[Tollen]], taking care of personal and party business. 

*Over the past few days, you have finished your business in [[Tollen]], for now, and said your goodbyes, with the hope to return soon. You are leaving with your stock of coin lighter by 22,500 gold, and without the [[Flaming Tempest]], the trade goods you recovered, or the [[Skaer steel]]. Some of this went to the purchase of a number of important components for spells (four jeweled bowls for Hero's Feast, diamond powder for Greater Restoration, two diamonds for raising the dead, should it be necessary, and ruby dust for Forbiddance), and a tattoo for [[Wellby]], but most was left behind with [[Adam Gower]], a trusted agent who has worked with the [[Goodbarrels]] in the past. Adam will coordinate with [[Umli]] to have the arrows and shield she is making transported to you via magical courier when ready, hire a crew to begin breaking down the [[Flaming Tempest]] into usable timber, and sell the trade goods. 

During this time, everyone has taken care of personal business, too. [[Seeker]] spends time contemplating the planes, and also composing a letter to his parents, updating them on where he has been and asking about [[Frankar]]'s disappearance. When not in thought, he is tinkering around the skyship with [[Faldrak Bronzehammer]]. 

[[Wellby]], in addition to getting his darkvision tattoo and connecting the party to [[Adam Gower]], has spent a lot of time with the [[Halflings|halfling]] community here, listening to stories, chatting with elders, and reconnecting with his roots. In his spare time, [[Wellby]] works on the growing map room on [[Vindristjarna]]. 

[[Kenzo]] spends time cultivating the garden on the skyship, and wandering [[Tollen]] learning of the local fauna and the local nature, while also spending time with [[Iskra]], who he shares a deep connection and spiritual journey with, and is perhaps kind of his girlfriend now. While not out and about, [[Kenzo]] has also been working on a hall of stories for the ship, in honor of [[Bhishma]], telling not just the tales of the party, but those they have met as well. 

[[Delwath]] spends time returning to his quartermaster roots, both working on the kitchen and the storerooms on [[Vindristjarna]], and spending time stocking the ship with a variety of useful goods for the journey. He also visits [[Melindir]] again, and gets the packet of letters he promised to deliver to [[Orenlas]].

The party departs [[Tollen]] the morning of January 6th, crossing the [[Western Gulf]] and arriving on the western shores of [[Cymea]] by nightfall on January 7th. Traveling through the night and into the morning, the party arrives at the Freccila River and the cave entrance to the[[ Edge of Echoes]] at midday. Before exploring, they are interrupted by the arrival of a paper bird bearing a [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Frankar|message]] for [[Seeker]].

The party explores a bit, with the aid of a bat summoned from [[Wellby]]'s hat, [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] and [[Seeker]] investigating the cave, and [[Kenzo]] communing with nature. Eventually they determine that the best course of action is to continue down the river. Pulling out the portable boat, they set out with [[Wellby]] taking the helm. 

After navigating a brief stretch of rapids, the party hears the roar of a waterfall ahead. [[Delwath]] sends a moth to scout, and reports the waterfall falls into a large underground lake. At the last minute, [[Wellby]] tries to stop the boat as he notices a landing area on the top of the waterfall, but slightly mistimes the immovable rod activation, so is instead left hanging above the lake while the rest of the party and the boat falls over the edge. [[Seeker]] and [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] fall into the lake, while [[Delwath]] and [[Kenzo]] manage to reactivate the boat and land safety on it. 

Before the party can regroup, everybody but [[Wellby]] is surprised by the sudden emergence of several water creatures, some shaped like giant flying manta rays, other more like elemental forces of water. They attack, trying to drag the party into the water and pull them down into the depths. The water elemental succeeds in grabbing [[Seeker]] and beginning to drag him into the depths, until it is banished (temporarily) by [[Delwath]]. [[Seeker]] and Faldrak are both able to use magic to teleport to shore, while [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] defend the boat and eventually take down the elementals attacking, and [[Wellby]] shoots from a distance.

The party continues into a large, clearly constructed room that is just off the small shoreline of the underground lake. Two rows of columns support the ceiling and lead towards a large stone door. The entire hall seems to be overgrown with stone, that creeps and oozes over everything like some kind of strange fungal growth. After some investigation, [[Seeker]] and [[Delwath]] try to crack open the stone that encrusts the door, while [[Wellby]] scouts some other tunnels. 

As [[Seeker]] chips a big crack in the stone around the door, suddenly, the floor turns to mud, and [[Seeker]] sinks up to his chin. It takes some effort, but [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] manage to pull him out. Each attempt to crack open the stone seems to cause more mud patches to open up in the floor. As the party dodges around the mud, Faldrak uses his cane to cast Shatter at the stone, causing it to burst open. Between [[Delwath]]'s fly spell, [[Wellby]]'s armor, and the [[Raven]] Whistle, the entire party is able to fly above the sticky mud on the floor, into the passageway.

The corridor splits, and the party turns left, with [[Wellby]] scouting ahead. Soon ahead, he encounters a swirling wind, fragments of voices of all kinds, whispering for a new tale of freedom. [[Wellby]] tells them about the [[Kenku]] who flew from one end of the Endless Isles to the other, and the winds quiet. Further down, mists envelope the corridor, dotted with dancing lights that entice you to join them, but [[Wellby]] resists their call and steps forward. The mists clear, revealing a door, covered in magical runes.

The rest of the party, warned by [[Wellby]] about what to expect, proceeds, telling their tales of freedom to the whispering winds, and resisting the lures of the dancing lights and mists. Except for [[Seeker]], who is distracted, lured in, by the shimmering colors of the lights in the mist, colors he has never seen before. It takes some time, but finally he is released from the allure of the mists by [[Kenzo]], and the party regroups at the door. 

The door is not locked, and [[Seeker]] identifies the runes as providing magical protection against elemental incursions. We end as the party steps through the door, into an antechamber with three exits. Stepping from the far wall is a woman, maybe sixty or so, elegantly dressed in silk robes, with graying hair cut short, green eyes, and sharp and angular face marked by a scar or old burn running from her left eye to her jawline. She bows slightly, and speaks before you can say anything. [[Kenzo]] recognizes the language as Drankorian, and translates:

*Greetings, visitors. I hope your journey was not too difficult. I am looking forward to consulting with you on your needs, but sadly I am indisposed at the moment. Until I return, my servant Claudio will tend to your needs. Please, be comfortable, and I will be with you shortly.*

As she finishes speaking, she gives a slight bow, and then vanishes.

### The Mirror of the Past
 - (DR:: 1749-01-08) [[The Mirror of the Past]] used to look at the [[Fides Lucaris]] sending stone, seeing the [[Fides Lucaris Sending Stone Vision]]. (recharge:: mirror)

## Narrative
We begin in the [[Elemental Forge|underground Drankorian ruins]], in the antechamber of the elemental forge and workshop, as the party contemplates three doors: one, an elegant bronze door leading to the forge itself, where a manacled skeleton lays on the ground; another, a rotten wooden door leading to living chambers; and the third, a solid stone door. Deciding to explore before entering the forge chamber, the party first scouts the living quarters. 

The living quarters are mostly decayed away to nothing over the thousand years since this set of rooms were occupied, with very little left to find. [[Seeker]] and [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] find themselves quite distracted by a crack in the wall of the storeroom, through which they can see a tunnel leading away from this area, with some strange out-of-place rocks on the ground, while [[Wellby]] and [[Kenzo]] search the other rooms, finding very little except for a small book (entitled "The [[Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum]]", otherwise blank, and clearly magical) and a silver water pitcher, also magical. [[Delwath]] manages to keep the [[Dwarves]] from venturing down the tunnel, and the party regroups to discuss in the storeroom. [[Delwath]] also notes a magical stone chest, in which 1000 year old venison is perfectly preserved. 

Seeking more information about this place, and hoping to avoid dangerous and unexpected encounters, the party leaves the tunnel and heads through the stone door, which leads to a workshop. This is clearly a well-maintained and well-stocked jeweler's workshop; not only are there tools but there are a number of strange components that appear to be materials used in the construction of magic items, in addition to mundane tools and materials. 

Searching for secret compartments, [[Wellby]] finds a hidden shelf in the wall that contains a lead box. Inside are a number of magical items, including a spellbook and wand; a vial of universal solvent; a sending stone; and a magical cloak. 

The party has a late lunch while [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] identifies the items. After a short break, the party shows the sending stone to [[The Mirror of the Past]], seeing a [[Fides Lucaris Sending Stone Vision|vision of a woman using the stone at several points.]] Concluding that the woman who carried this stone must have more information (and is probably now dead -- the skeleton in the forge chamber), the party decides to try communicating with whomever has the other pair of this stone, now. They reach a small boy, maybe four or five, named [[Lucius]], who lives in the village of [[Luminatia]] near [[Lake Valandros]], and thinks the voice is his imaginary friend, Benji. He lives with his mom, [[Livia]]; his dad, [[Claudio]] left and he just barely remembers him. [[Lucius]] found the stone in his dad's stuff after his mom kicked his dad out -- he doesn't really remember, it was a year ago, he says. They do okay -- his mom runs the only inn in town, but there aren't as many travelers these days, [[Lucius]] says. 

After some more discussion, the party decides the next step to sorting out the mystery is to speak with the dead skeleton in the elemental forge chamber, using the scroll of "Speak with Dead" the party has been carrying for a while. Preparing for anything, and stepping through the door, the party finds the elemental forge, connected to the ground with four wires of silver thread, two of which have been destroyed, hanging loose. Approaching the dead body, [[Seeker]] reads the scroll and the dead body animates. The party questions [[Fides Lucaris spy|this woman]], learning that she was a member of a Drankorian secret society, the [[Fides Lucaris]], and came on a mission to this place to free the elemental being trapped by the wizards of the [[Occulta Ludum]], who cared only for power, not the feelings of the creatures they bound. She failed; she was bound and killed by [[Drusilia]], presumably the caretaker of this place for the [[Occulta Ludum]], but not before destroying two of the anchors that held the elemental in place. Now prepared to continue the mission of the [[Fides Lucaris]], they ask if the dead woman knows how to decipher the [[Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum]]. She answers no, but that the [[Elves]], [[Elandrial]], was working on this. 

At this point, the party prepares for combat as the elemental storm that has been rising through the floor erupts. [[Wellby]], with the universal solvent, focuses on dissolving the two remaining silver wires connecting the forge to the floor. Meanwhile, [[Seeker]] uses Psychic Lance to keep the emerging elemental storm incapacitated, while [[Kenzo]] communes with the creature to attempt to calm it, and [[Delwath]] handles the elementals that emerge from the dissolved silver threads. Although [[Seeker]] is nearly knocked unconscious, the party manages to free and calm the elemental. 

In the aftermath of the battle, [[Kenzo]] reaches into the mind of the elemental, and glimpses bits of its story. Long ago, many hundreds of years, it was living on the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]. A vision of an impossible staircase of clouds, stretching to infinity, children of air and cloud running, throwing bits of cloudstuff at eachother as a game. A vision of a palace made of lightning, a creature studying in a grand hall, images appearing in the crackling electricity. A vision of a creature of air and smoke, exploring a strange landscape of dark mist and ash drifting through the sky, with three companions. Finally, a vision of the same group of air creatures encountering [[Humans]], flying through the air; one of the [[Humans]] speaks in Drankorian, his words taking on an impossible tone as reality is reshaped by his very commands, and at his wish silver threads appear and bind the elemental. And then the elemental drifts away, a last parting jolt of energy charging the forge. As it vanishes, it whispers it's name: "[[Sh’shethis]]".

With the elemental freed and gone, the magic of the forge only lingers for a few days: enough time for [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] to enhance his stone bird, improve [[Seeker]]'s glove, and construct two improvements for [[Vindristjarna]]. We end as crating begins.

- The party receives a [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones|message]] about binding stones from the Philosopher's Guild.

#### The Story of Apollyon and Cha'mutte

Piecing together what [[Arheste]] told you, you reconstruct the following timeline of [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] and [[Cha'mutte]]. 
This story is told from [[Arheste]]'s point of view [[Arheste#Arheste's Story|here]].

- After the Drankorian civil war, [[Omnis Pura]] and [[Cha'mutte]] became allies, and when [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] came to power, he continued to ally with [[Cha'mutte]]. 
- However, [[Cha'mutte]] became angry when [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] stole the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]] from the free [[orcs]], as [[Cha'mutte]]'s goal was to free all species from the "shackles" of their divine creators, whether they wished it or not. The cloak was a step in that direction. You saw part of this in the [[Mantle of Protection Vision]]. 
- As [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] grew in power, he began systematically slaughtering the peronar, the [[elves]] who had allied with [[humans]] long ago on [[Hkar]]. He used powerful magic to turn the people of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] into slavishly devoted subjects, hoping to further his dream of an empire of only the "purest" of humanity. 
- Using the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]], [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] was able to defeat the [[elves]] of [[Rostaure|Rostaurë]] ([[Arheste]]'s home), as the cloak prevented the divine power of [[Aldanor]] and[[Elmerca]] from protecting the land. He brought [[Arheste]], captured back to [[Drankor]], where she saw his rise to power firsthand. You saw some of this in the [[Scepter of Command Vision]]. 
- [[Cha'mutte]] fully turned on [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] when [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] attempted to ascend to godhood, in defiance of [[Cha'mutte]]'s plans and hopes for the world. At the moment [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] attempted to claim divine power, he was struck down by the [[First Plague]], a devastating magical force of [[Cha'mutte]]'s creation. 
- [[Arheste]] survived the plague, but at great cost. It left her sick and weakened, and stripped her of her formidable magic.
- [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] also survived the plague, by drinking of vial of a pure black substance. [[Arheste]] later learned that this was the key ingredient in a ritual of undeath, and had turned [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] into a lich.
- However, [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] was trapped by [[Cha'mutte]], who for unexplained reasons did not seek to destroy [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] utterly. Whether it was because he couldn't, or because he didn't want to, [[Arheste]] never learned. 
- When [[Cha'mutte]] was killed, [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] began to break free, until [[Rai]] teleported to [[Drankor]], warned by [[Arheste]], and sought to maintain the bonds. [[Arheste]] never learned how [[Rai]] did this, but speculated it was as simple as grasping [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s phylactery in his magical [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand|jade]] hand. 
- At the beginning of this leya, around 1720 as [[humans]] reckon time, [[Arheste]] felt something change. A break, a shift, in [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s bonds, letting him break free and slowly gain power, recovering from the weakness of his long imprisonment. 
- [[Arheste]], though too weak from the ongoing effects of plague exposure to seek [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] herself, will do anything in her power to ensure that he is defeated, once and for all, his phylactery destroyed utterly, and any hope of his resurrection crushed. 

The story of the scepter of command, as told in later days by the halflings, is [[Story of the Scepter of Command|here]].

## Narrative
We begin on [[Vindristjarna]], as the party has returned to the skyship after several days at the Elemental Forge while [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] constructed a number of magic items from the residual energy of the forge left behind by [[Sh’shethis]]'s departure. The day before, as [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] finished his work, the party had viewed the [[Elemental Forge Vision|forge itself in Eudomes' mirror]]. Now, we pick up as the party heads south for [[Orenlas]], and [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] writes in his [[Faldrak's Journal Notes|journal]].

[[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]]'s writing is interrupted by the arrival of another message from the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers|Philosopher's Guild]], this time concerning [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones|the binding stones]]. The party reads and discusses. 

The next day, the ship arrives at the edge of [[Orenlas]]. The forest is shrouded in mists, and the party is forced to land outside, on the shores of the large lake, using the [[Vindristjarna#Planar Prism|planar prism]] for the first time to construct a rainbow bridge from the ship to the ground. While Faldrak stays behind, the party ventures into the forest.

The paths open up as they walk, revealing visions and fragments of dreams of possible futures: Kenzo, mediating in an alien place of impossible depth; Delwath, traveling across the planes, protecting those in need across the multiverse; Seeker, writing a book in his home full of the laughter of his children and visions of his friends across the multiverse; Wellby, at sea, leagues and leagues west of any known land, perhaps, just perhaps glimpsing sight of a mountain rising from the horizon in the distance. You feel, as you walk, that this is Aldanor testing your desires, your hopes, and accepting you.

The party arrives at the gates of [[Erelion]], where they are greeted by Caretaker [[Erdhin]]. He settles the party in a guest house of a sort; plans are made for a dinner party; and then the group leaves to experience the wonders of the city. 

The party strolls through the fey gardens where silver grows in delicate flowers, where vines are laden with fruit at all seasons, where oysters grown from the roots of lily pads. They find their way to the massive elder tree, the tree of dreaming, the sacred space where the echoes of the footsteps of [[Aldanor]] on the land, that created the first forests, can still be heard. Kenzo communes with the forest, and is gently guided to safer paths, told he is not ready for this, the original forest, the place that still retains some of the magic of the days of myth when the world was young. 

After an afternoon exploring, the party returns and hosts guests for dinner, cooked by [[Delwath]]. In addition to Caretaker [[Erdhin]], the guests are a young gardener named [[Ealwen]], a retired solider named[[Vahaiya]], and a poet named [[Cirdore]]. As conversation flows, the party learns there is an elder here who could speak of Apollyon and Drankor; her name is [[Arheste]], and unlike nearly any other elf her age, she is very sick. [[Ealwen]], her caretaker, is reluctant to disturb her, but relents after speaking at length about herbs and ki and healing powers with [[Kenzo]]. While [[Ealwen]] does not feel she can leave [[Erelion]], she does say she has a few people in mind who might want to join the ship as a gardener. 

The next morning, the party travels with [[Ealwen]] to visit [[Arheste]], outside the city. [[Arheste]] is clearly ill, unable to sit without wheezing, and struggles to tell her story until [[Kenzo]] uses some of his precious ki from the jungles of [[Orekatu]] to ease her damaged soul. While not strong enough to completely undo the evils done to her, it helps, tremendously. 

For the rest of the day, Arheste tells her story, about Drankor and Apollyon and Cha'mutte, which is recorded [[Arheste#Arheste's Story|here]].

As evening comes, the party receives a desperate plea for help from Riswynn: [[Grash]] is nearly done constructing a massive trebuchet, and if they do not arrive to help soon, the city will be destroyed.

### Timeline
- (DR:: 1748-01-17): [[Vindristjarna]] flies over the [[Plaguelands]] as the party races towards Uzguhkhar
- (DR:: 1748-01-18): [[Vindristjarna]] flies over the [[Plaguelands]] as the party races towards Uzguhkhar
- (DR:: 1748-01-19): [[Vindristjarna]] flies over the [[Plaguelands]] as the party races towards Uzguhkhar
- (DR:: 1748-01-20): The party arrives in [[Uzgukhar]] soon after sunrise. [[Riswynn]] rejoins the group. Together, they destroy a massive trebuchet, fight off specters, and kill [[Grash]] in the [[Battle for Uzgukhar]]. [[Wellby]] is killed, and resurrected. The people of [[Uzgukhar]] celebrate survival. 
## Narrative
We begin on [[Vindristjarna]], racing towards [[Uzgukhar]]. The party uses the few days of travel to learn what they can about [[Grash]], and the [[Ring of Undying]], from the various stories collected by [[Kenzo]] and the maps and lore and [[Halflings|halfling]] memories maintained by [[Wellby]]. 

Arriving a few hours after sunrise on January 20, 1748, the bombardment of [[Uzgukhar]] has already begun. A massive trebuchet, at least 300 feet tall, stands on the battlefield, capable of slinging rocks big enough to crush walls and houses, from more than 1000 feet from the city. Lines of [[undead]], mostly orc zombies, pull on massive ropes to winch up the counterweight for another blast. It is clear that the city cannot survive a full day of this. Arrayed around the city in siege lines are many more [[undead]], supported by swarms of specters and shades swooping overhead. In trenches, shadow dogs wait for nightfall, when they can run through the city unchecked. 

The party quickly leaps into action. [[Seeker]] creates a massive boulder, ten feet on a side, as [[Vindristjarna]] rises to 300 feet above the battlefield. Even as shades and specters rush to intercept the ship, the boulder (decorated to look like a ladder) launches itself from the deck. Never before has a boulder fallen so precisely from such a great height. With a mighty crack, the flying boulder-ladder hits the center of the long arm of the trebuchet directly, splintering into hundreds of pieces and utterly destroying the siege machine and itself in the process. Later, [[Seeker]] will build a memorial to the short-lived hero: "Lord Boulder, hero of the [[Battle for Uzgukhar]] smasher of the trebuchet, liberator of the missile stones, star among rocks”. 

![[battle-for-uzgukhar.jpeg]]

With the trebuchet destroyed, the party fights off a group of shades and specters, and turns to find [[Grash]]. He is standing, watching the battle, seemingly unconcerned with the arrival of a flying skyship, and is ready, waiting, for the party.

While [[Seeker]] hides on the deck of [[Vindristjarna]] slinging spells from a distance, the rest of the party engages. [[Grash]] fights viciously with his wicked glaive, every slash leaving a bleeding wound that makes movement painful, and his cloak of shadows protecting him and retaliating when cut or pierced. With the [[Ring of Undying]], he summons cursed chains that bind the arms of his enemies, weakening them and binding them closer to death. The party fights back with [[Delwath]]'s sword, [[Wellby]]'s bow, [[Kenzo]]'s fists, [[Riswynn]]'s divine sunbeam, and [[Seeker]]'s incapacitating lance of psychic energy. [[Grash]] stumbles, but cannot die: when it seems he might die, the ring draws the life force of those around him to restore him to life again. 

As the battle progresses, and [[Grash]] slows, finally there is an opening to cut off his hand and take, and destroy, the [[Ring of Undying]]. Wounded and close to unconsciousness, and bound in place by shadowy claws summoned by [[Grash]], [[Kenzo]], who has channeled [[Motua]] and dodged [[Grash]]'s glaive the whole battle, summons the claws of [[Lengau]], and slashes as [[Grash]]'s wrist, severing his hand. With an off-balance throw, he tosses the hand to [[Wellby]], who barely grabs it, as the shadow claws slash at [[Kenzo]], dragging him to unconsciousness. [[Wellby]], the [[Ring of Undying]] in hand, takes out a vial of [[Universal Solvent]], and uses the last drop to dissolve the binds of the [[Land of the Dead]] that are wrapped around the ring, disintegrating it and unleashing a burst of necrotic energy that knocks [[Wellby]] unconscious. [[Grash]], overcome with rage, shadow steps to [[Wellby]], who is standing on a stone arch above the desert, and strikes him, once, twice with his glaive, and then pushed him to the ground below, dead. [[Delwath]], seeing the ring destroyed, teleports to [[Grash]] and then, with a cut of his sword, kills him. 

The party retreats to [[Vindristjarna]] as the [[undead]] hordes begin to waver, and fall, every zombie, shade, or skeleton brought back by the power of the ring now unmade and returned to death. [[Riswynn]] prays to the [[Bahrazel]], channeling her magic through a perfect diamond, which sparkles and shatters with images of [[Wellby]]: a map, a compass, a ship on the open ocean searching for distant lands. As the spell completes, [[Wellby]] is brought back to life, shaken. 

For the rest of the day, the party helps the [[People of the Rainbow|orcs]] of [[Uzgukhar]] destroy the few [[undead]] and other creatures left in [[Grash's Horde|Grash's armies]], as [[Xurkhaz]] is saved and the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] protected. 

We end that evening, as the celebrations of survival and mourning for the dead last long into the night in [[Uzgukhar]], as the party hears stories of the [[People of the Rainbow]] from [[Murook]], [[Lubash]], and [[Azogar]], among many others.

### Mirror of the Past
- (DR:: 1749-01-26): The past of the Longsword of Heroism revealed in the [[Broken Dunmari Sword Vision]] (recharge:: mirror)
## Narrative
We begin in [[Uzgukhar]], at the celebration of the victory in the [[Battle for Uzgukhar]], after the unveiling of the statue of the hero [[Riswynn]] in the Plaza of Freedom. The party, and especially [[Riswynn]], are hailed as heroes and saviors, and the mood of relief and hope is palpable, overlaid on the mourning for those lost. As the evening progresses, Loremaster [[Azogar]] stands and in his frail but strong voice, speaks [[Tale of the Cloak of Rainbows|the full story]] of the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

For the next few days, the party rests in [[Uzgukhar]], giving time for [[Wellby]] to recover from his death, and taking a well-deserved breather after the battle. [[Kenzo]] marks the Dunmari new year, the 192nd year of the [[Nayan Dynasty]], on January 23rd, beginning to develop his own new traditions of meditation and worship. As they prepare to leave, to head west to reconnect with Pava and [[Avaras]] and perhaps recruit [[Amil]] to join their crew, two orc women approach, [[Nuzkar]] and [[Aygul]], asking to join the crew. That day, January 24th, is an uneventful day of travel over the [[Garamjala Desert]]. 

The next day, January 25th, the party receives another message from the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers|Philosopher's Guild]], concerning [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand|Rai's hand]]. The [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Rai's Hand|message]] is strange. After discussing the message for a short time, the party finds themselves passing over the now-empty city of [[Kharsan]], once Grash's base, and decides to investigate. [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] sees this as a perfect opportunity to be allowed to fly [[Vindristjarna]], but the party is not quite ready to allow this, it seems.

[[Kharsan]] seems relatively quiet. The party explores the palace, which was once Grash's headquarters, but now seems abandoned. The stables and great hall are ruined and cleared out; further searching uncovers a few restless haunted spirits of the plague dead in the old kitchens, which are easily dispatched. The remains of Grash's looting operation are also in the palace, along with a few treasures missed or destroyed. The most informative find is what looks like a planning room, with a map table and slate to draw on. It has been smashed, but from the available pieces and clues it seems pretty clear that [[Grash]] was planning on attacking [[Dunmar]] had he succeeded in getting the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

Exploring the rest of the city, the party casually slays a few more specters, and stumbles across the library, which is now a giant wasp nest, but the wasps are immediately destroyed by [[Delwath]]'s sickening radiance spell. Although most of the paper has been shredded and turned to giant wasp nesting material, something might be salvageable, and it is packed for transport to [[Vindristjarna]] where perhaps [[Nuzkar]] will see what she can decipher from it. The party also briefly explores the orc warren, which is empty, but the central building contains a series of gruesome murals depicting [[Grash]] is battle, slaughtering defenseless innocents as the avatar of [[Thark]].   

The next morning, on January 26th, the party briefly returns to [[Kharsan]] with the orcs [[Nuzkar]] and [[Aygul]]. [[Nuzkar]] is deeply saddened by the orc warren, mourning the hundreds of orcs who must have been born and bound to [[Thark]] here, and asks the party to burn it all. [[Kenzo]] and [[Riswynn]], as the orc warren burns, cleanse the spirits of the place as well, and see not just the orcs, but many others, especially the Dunmari who died in the [[Great War]], trapped between the plague consuming [[Kharsan]] and a wall of fire summoned to prevent them from reaching the safety of the [[Monastery of Bhishma]] nearby. As the fire burns, [[Kenzo]] feels [[Bhishma]]'s hand freeing the trapped, lost souls still stuck here, and [[Wellby]] briefly sees again the [[Land of the Dead|river of souls]] where he spent an hour before being resurrected by [[Riswynn]]'s magic. 

That afternoon, before departing [[Kharsan]], the party looks at the [[Broken Dunmari Sword Vision|broken Dunmari sword]] in [[The Mirror of the Past]]. The next day the party travels west, and arrives at [[Pava and Avaras' House]] on January 28th. Here, they meet [[Kethra]], a dwarven smith and great-grandaughter of [[Nora Silverspark]], who has traveled far searching for [[Riswynn]], hoping she'll be her mentor. They also speak at length with [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]], who are very happy to see everyone looking so well. [[Pava]] wishs to record [[Delwath]]'s story, and is amazed at how [[Kenzo]] has started to reinterpret and expand the [[Bhishma]] traditions of storytelling in new ways, asking if [[Kenzo]] would take [[Amil]] with him as an apprentice. The party spends the next day just catching up and resting at [[Pava and Avaras' House]].

As they prepare to leave on January 30th, with [[Amil]] and [[Kethra]] joining the crew of [[Vindristjarna]], [[Pava]] updates them on the situation in [[Dunmar]], between [[Sura]] and [[Nayan Karnas]]. We end as the party considers intervening.

As our session begins underneath the mountains, across the dusty plains and deserts of [[Dunmar]], people are moving. In the west, a tired mass of refugees flees [[Karawa]], hopefully now nearing the River [[Hara]] and the outskirts of [[Tokra]]. To the south, [[Alesh]] and her small group of companions ride quickly and quietly through the deserts, hopefully avoiding danger along the way as they try to learn what lurks in the ruins of [[Bas Udda]] and beyond. In [[Karawa]], the acolytes and initiates of the [[Shakun Mystai]] remain holed up in the [[Temple of Shakun]], as [[Centaurs]] ride fast towards them, bringing news, and perhaps aid in battle, should it be needed, and not too late already.

The party stands in the center of a large, open cavern, a former marketplace and center of trade when this outpost was full of dwarven life. The party spends some time investigating the dead body of the roper, and the remains of the tavern or inn in the cavern. Untouched by the strong acid of the roper’s stomach, they discover a [[Pearl of Power|small pearl]], magical, and able to restore some spellcasting energy. In the tavern, they find graffiti -- a three-fingered, clawed hand, with the three fingers burned to the bone -- which [[Wellby]] recognizes as a [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] banner, something his people have fled from before. 

After taking a brief rest in the ruins of the tavern, and doing a bit of scouting, the party turns back to the creature [[Inakara]], to try to bargain or threaten their way back into the passageways to the vault. When asking nicely doesn’t seem to get them what they want, and when [[Inakara]] lights up at the mention of the vault, a combination of light bribery and some intimidating displays of simple magic gets her to agree to lead them to the vault. 

As the party approaches the vault, [[Inakara]] disappears, pointing them down the tunnel in the direction of the vault, but actually following invisibly, which [[Wellby]] notices, but ultimately the party leaves her to watch as they investigate the strange mirror doors of the dwarven vault. [[Seeker]] and [[Riswynn]] eventually notice that, when looking in the reflected image of the two circular doors, keys appear around the necks of two statues positioned adjacent to the entryway, and that removing the keys is possible as long as you never remove your eyes from the reflection. Upon opening the doors and entering the vault, the party is confronted with a scene of death and destruction, albeit one undisturbed for many, many years. Five dead [[Dwarves]], and one dead [[Ithilids|mind flayer]] (with its head smashed in) are arrayed inside the vault, which as been partially emptied. The treasure that remains includes the [[Shield of the Brawnanvil Clan]], [[Riswynn]]’s goal, as well as a [[Shatterstorm|rune-inscribed magical warhammer]], a chest containing six potion bottles and two [[Driftglobe|driftglobes]], and a number of gold and silver trade bars stamped with the Brawnanvil clan sign. The mind flayer, though long dead, is somewhat troubling, especially as [[Inakara]] seemed to be muttering frequently about the brain eaters and their return. Although given her state of mind, whether this is something actually to be concerned about, or a fevered imagining from her paranoid state is quite unclear. In any case, this particular [[Ithilids|mind flayer]] seemed to have been killed a century or more ago, by [[Dwarves]].

After taking some time to pay respects for the dead and examine the treasure, the party decided to explore the inner chamber of the vault, where a rubble-strew crack in the side of a wall formed the opening to a tunnel heading west. After [[Seeker]] cleared the loose stone, [[Delwath]] investigated the tunnel, turning invisible first to maintain stealth. Eventually, the tunnel ended in what seemed to be a mine shaft, stretching both above and below the tunnel entrance, where signs of [[adamantine]] ore remained. 

Returning to the vault entrance and [[Inakara]], [[Riswynn]] with the aid of the rest of the party, and [[Kenzo]]’s soul sight, negotiates passage to a tunnel leading east towards [[Raven's Hold]] for two silver bars, plus three when they arrive at the tunnel. Along the way, some discussion of the mind flayers’ return occurs, with [[Inakara]] seemingly excited that, with the roper dead, the mind flayers have a clear path (although the rumors and legends of mind flayers suggests they are much, much more deadly than the stalagmite scavenger known as a roper).

We leave our heroes contemplating a locked iron grate in front of a tunnel sloping down to the east, [[Inakara]] retreating in the distance. ---

## Narrative
We begin as the party departs [[Pava and Avaras' House]], heading west to [[Sura]]'s army camp in the [[Copper Hills]], hoping to negotiate a peace between Sura and her brother, Samraat [[Nayan Karnas]]. In Vindristjarna, the journey across Dunmar takes only two days, and the party arrives at Sura's camp on the morning of February 1st.

Here, they begin by speaking to Sura. They give her news of the [[War of the Cloak]], the [[Battle for Uzgukhar]], and the defeat of [[Grash]]. Sura passes along the news of the [[Battle of Tokra]], and [[Havdar]]'s activities to fortify the northwestern border of [[Dunmar]], along the [[Myraeni Gap]]. Then, the conversation turns to Karnas and the current situation. Karnas is convinced that [[Agata]] has silenced the gods using the [[Cloak of Rainbows]], and corrupted Sura to be her pawn. The party learns from Sura that [[Johar]], Kenzo's friend from the [[Lakan Monastery]], has been taking letters between the camps, and the [[Sonkar Mystai]] [[Abha]] is Karnas' closest advisor, although currently he is convinced that nothing she says can be trusted, because of Agata's meddling with the gods. 

The conversation turns to meeting with [[Nayan Karnas|Karnas]], and to Sura's feelings. [[Sura]] asks [[Delwath]] if he has ever been trapped in a mirror for eight years, which, between Delwath's skill and [Seeker]'s inspiration, leads to her breaking down and talking about how angry she is with Karnas for doing nothing. As the conversation continues, Sura agrees to come meditate with [[Kenzo]] in the evening, and also hears the whole story of [[Apollyon]] from the party. 

That afternoon, the party speaks with [[Johar]]. He is nervous, and reports on the evidence of Agata's meddling in Dunmari history that Karnas has found. Most notable is a letter, written by the Samraat [[Marathu]], who was Sura's mentor and killed in the attack when Sura was kidnapped. The letter, according to Karnas, states that Marathu had visited Agata in his youth, and was compelled now to deliver Sura to her, for training and apprenticeship. Johar lists a bunch of other evidence he has found of Agata's meddling. The discussion also turns to the [[Cloak of Rainbows]], which has definitely been with the orcs of [[Xurkhaz]] since shortly after the [[Great War]], and so can't have been used by Agata. Johar is convinced, but he warns the party Karnas will not be easy to deal with. 

The meeting with Johar ends with Johar arranging a meeting with [[Abha]], who will speak with the party the following day around lunchtime, near Karnas' camp. The rest of the day and evening is spent in discussion, and in prayer and meditation with Sura. Delwath also speaks with the tanshi, asking:

- Can Agatha influence Dunmar from where she is now? *Probably not*
- Did Agatha leave behind magical traps and tricks still active in Dunmar. *No*
- Was Sura in the mirror for eight years? *Yes*
- Was Samraat Nayan Marathu truthful in the letter he wrote to be opened after his death? *What letter?*
- Does Abha have Dunmar's best interests at heart? *Yes*

The next day at lunchtime, the party uses the rainbow bridge to teleport to the spot they are to meet [[Abha]]. They speak with her about the situation, and the [[Cloak of Rainbows]], and the uncertainty in Dunmar. She seems to accept the story of the cloak and clearly wants to convince Karnas that the gods have not been silenced by Agata, and agrees to take the party to him. While she warns them he will not accept divine magic, he may be open to other magic that could convince him Agata is not influencing Sura.

The party is led by Abha through Karnas' camp, to the main room of the caravanserai he has made into his hall. The party tells Karnas the story of the [[War of the Cloak]], keeping the true nature of the [[People of the Rainbow]] a secret. Karnas seems uncertain, wondering if Agata had sway with these people, which turns the conversation to Agata and how they defeated her twice.

Convinced the party is not under Agata's sway, the conversation turns to Sura, and the evidence that Karnas has marshaled of Agata's meddling. Karnas seems obsessed with the letter from [[Marathu]], implicating Sura, that Johar mentioned. The party discusses using the [[The Mirror of the Past]] to learn about [[Nayan Marathu's Letter]], but makes a final attempt to convince Karnas to come see the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] for himself, first. But he is unwilling to leave his camp and teleport away with strangers. 

Finally, over Kenzo's qualms, the party decides to show the letter to the [[The Mirror of the Past]], which reveals [[Nayan Marathu's Letter Vision|Agata's role in crafting the letter]]. This sends Karnas into a rage, and the party leaves. Later, speaking to [[Abha]], she tells the party that this is the first crack, and she thinks this will be the first step in a path to reconciliation and a negotiation over Dunmar's future. But, at this point, it is up to the gods and their representatives on Taelgar to find a way forward. She thanks the party for their help, agreeing to speak with Sura and start negotiations, and wishes them well. 

The party spends the next day tying up loose ends to help the negotiations get started, with Kenzo leaving carved wooden figurines of a united brother and sister for both Sura and Karnas. On February 4th, they depart on Vindristjarna, heading east for Orenlas, and then Tollen, arriving at Tollen in mid-February. 

During this time, the party [[Flashback (Orenlas Gardener)|recruits a gardener in Orenlas]], and [[Interlude (Tollen Downtime)|gathers information]]. 

On March 9th, in Tollen, the party meets [[Kecha]], the kenku scout who has volunteered to lead them across the northern wilds, to the inland border of [[Ursk]]. He tells them of the dangers they may face: frost giants in the mountains; dragons in the icy north; rumors of a vampire kingdom; ice worms that tear through the forest; and changelings who turn into bears. 

In the early morning hours, as the party sleeps on Vindristjarna, they are awakened by screams.
